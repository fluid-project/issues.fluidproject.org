Editing the slider value in the text box, causes keyboard incrementing of the slider thumb to append a 1 to the value

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Sakai mock-up example

2\) Open the UI Options dialog and modify one of the text field sliders by typing in a new value in the textfield

3\) tab or shift-tab back to the slider thumb and increment it via the keyboard

Notice that the thumb jumps to the end of the slider, and the value in the textfield now has a "1" appended to it.

This occurs whether or not you save the change to the textfield, or not.
