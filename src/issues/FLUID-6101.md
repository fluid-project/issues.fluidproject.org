I removed the ToC element and saw that the generated site had no regressions.\n\nI think we should remove the ToC placeholder altogether instead of modifying it.Â \n\nWhat do you think?\n"

In UI Options, the Table of Contents placeholder container should be a \<nav> element instead of a \<div> element to be more semantically correct.

[See W3C \<nav> guideline](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/nav)
