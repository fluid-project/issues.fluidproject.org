We have started to describe how to create various types of user and behavioral models on the Fluid wiki.  Let's time box some additional work in this are for this iteration.

* create information architecture for this space on the wiki:  Barbara and Daphne both created initial pages. These need to be coordinated and can be used as the base for the space.
* &#x20;identify types of models to include in the "how to"
* create "how tos"
