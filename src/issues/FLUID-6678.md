Currently we pull in OpenDyslexic via <https://github.com/ssbc/open-dyslexic>Â However, it adds a bit of confusion regarding the license, as they layer their own license on top. It would probably be clearer to just fork the [OpenDyslexic](https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic) repo and create an NPM package scoped to our own org.

Note: this is needed because OpenDyslexic is not distributed via NPM directly.
