As part of the Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) project one of our partners attempted to integrate UIO into their React app but had some problems sorting out how to best do that. Aside from the usual styling tweaks needed, they were unable to run UIO inside of their React web app.

We should come up with some documentation to help guide the process for integrating UIO inside of a React application. [React](https://reactjs.org) is a popular JavaScript library for building web apps, so the additional integration instructions should help many would be integrators.Â
