There's a known issue in IE8 - font icons sometimes do not update until interacted-with. See <http://andymcfee.com/2012/04/icon-fonts-pseudo-elements-and-ie8/> for details.&#x20;

This is most noticeable when using UIOptions (fat panel) - make preference changes and font icons within the page do not update until clicked on or used. Close the panel and reopen, and font icons in UIO are not consistently updated as well.
