Steps to reproduce

1\) Open up the video player demo

2\) hover over the video to reveal the controls

3\) open the volume controls and use the mouse to start adjusting the slider

4\) while dragging, move the mouse so that the cursor is not overtop of the volume slider\
Notice that the volume slider has disappeared. Note, you are still controlling the slider though. So moving up and down will actually adjust the volume. You can see this by releasing the mouse and opening the volume slider again to see that it is in the position you release it at. Also you can do this while the video is playing and hear the volume go up and down.
