The tests for sjrk.storyTelling.page.storyEdit currently fail if they are run after the tests for sjrk.storyTelling.page, because the latter sets the language cookie to Spanish and the former expects values in English.

This is symptomatic of the message\_readStoryText value containing set values in the given language, instead of being dynamically composed of other messages (like message\_authorText). This can be tackled later.

A simple solution for the time being could be something like switching the language click tests on page to run English second instead of first, or calling something to clear the cookie at the end of the sequence.
