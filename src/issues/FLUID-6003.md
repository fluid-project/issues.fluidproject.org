The Infusion build on Jenkins is not deleting old content when publishing the resulting files. This is causeing stale content to remain available, which leads to confused users.

The Publish Over SSH plugin does not support removing remote files (see [JENKINS-33056](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33056)), even though the Jenkins Job Builder definition lists a "[clean-remote](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/publishers.html#publishers.ssh)" option. Enabling this option causes the publisher to fail with a null error, when using the latest version of the plugin.
