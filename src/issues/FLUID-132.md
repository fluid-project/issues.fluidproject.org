Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the grid reordered demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/gridReorderer/>

2\) Place the mouse over one of the reorderable elements

3\) Using the keyboard move the other elements around.\
Notice that as an element passes under the mouse, it picks up and retains the hover styling.
