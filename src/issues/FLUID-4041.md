At the moment, we use File.getAsBinary() when passing the contents of a file to an XHR request in Firefox 3.6. getAsBinary() loads the entire file into memory, but is a blocking method, which means the entire browser chrome will spin until it has finished executing. The FileReader API is asynchronous, meaning the browser would remain more responsive while passing file to the XHR. We should investigate its use.
