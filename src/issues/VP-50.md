In IE8, you can not tab focus the video player container - therefore you can not press Enter or Space to play the video.

The container appears to be in the tab order, but no styling is applied and no actions are being registered.

To reproduce:

* In IE8 load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Press tab until focus is on UI Options
* Press tab once: notice that nothing appears to be in focus. (Outer container catching focus <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4785#icft=FLUID-4785>)
* Press tab again: notice nothing is in focus. (Video player should normally have focus)
* Press ENTER or Space play video - notice nothing happens.
* Press tab a 3rd time: Play button should now have focus.
