Originally UI Options had a minimum font size control which was set in pixels. The implementation would remove all the FSS classes that scale down the font size.\
Now we have a font size control that is a multiplication factor - not a control that sets the minimum size. FSS text size classes are all based on ems and will scale text size appropriately. We should no longer remove the FSS classes when we set the font size.&#x20;
