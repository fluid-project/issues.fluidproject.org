Am I correct?\n\nThe \"Abuse reported\" text is a link, but should be \"dead,\" in that it shouldn't be tappable, nor should it provide any highlight or affordance of tappability.\n\nIf so, the reason is probably because of this class, set in engage-mobile.css:\n\n.fl-theme-iphone .fl-engage-tappable {\\\n-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,255,0.5);\\\n}\n\nAntranig, you probably just need to override your link to set a completely transparent (0,0,0,0) tap highlight or similar hack.\n"

Users can tap on the "Abuse reported. Pending moderator review." text and receive visual feedback. i.e., it acts like a link that goes nowhere. Intended behavior: it should act like regular text.
