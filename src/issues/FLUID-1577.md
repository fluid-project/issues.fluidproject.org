Mouse hover styling persists on file names

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader

2\) Add some files to the file queue

3\) Using the mouse, place the pointer over a file name. Move the pointer out of the file queue on the files names right side.

Notice that the mouse hover styling remains.&#x20;

Repeating step 3 will allow you to place the mouse hover styling over all of the file names in the queue
