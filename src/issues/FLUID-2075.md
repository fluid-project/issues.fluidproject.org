Iterate on Undo Icon in Inline edit, as we aren't entirely happy with it now. The circle-arrow may not be exactly the right icon (we may want to consider using an Undo icon from a rich-text editor like TinyMCE or FCKEditor since they are somewhat standard and the icons may be open source), and we think the contrast may not be sufficient on the initial Undo icon (when it isn't being moused over).

After the icon is improved in the Section Info demo, we may want to make it the default for the component, instead of the "\[Undo]" text.
