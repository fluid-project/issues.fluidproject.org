Are you able to provide the various button images (in all their various colours) for the interface?\n\nAlso, I don't see anything in the designs about what the captions should look like (as opposed to transcripts), e.g. where they should be positioned, colours, etc.\n\nAlso, not sure what tooltip should look like.\n"
