When converting the pager to use self-rendered version by default ( for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2329#icft=FLUID-2329> ), some problematic configuration was added at the same time.&#x20;

<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/5c50980c58cb59498c187d8871c2e50c5ebf7a79/src/webapp/components/pager/js/Pager.js#L857-865>

The "annotateColumnRange" option should have been left as undefined, and there shouldn't have been any default "columnDefs". In place of the "columnDefs" a comment explaining how to fill it out would have been better. Something like what was done in the progressiveEnhancer.

<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/webapp/framework/enhancement/js/ProgressiveEnhancement.js#L52>

This issue was reported in the fluid-work irc channel:\
