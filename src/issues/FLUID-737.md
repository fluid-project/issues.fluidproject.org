Schedule and facilitate a design review with the UX team.  Should we include the dev team now or after it's reviewed by designers first?

Walk team through scenarios and storyboards to describe new designs.  Be prepared to discuss rationale along the way.

Shared task by Daphne & Erin - 1 hr each.  30 - 45 minutes for the actual review
