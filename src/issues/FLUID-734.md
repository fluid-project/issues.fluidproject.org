This task will be much easier to do once the personas are in their new formats.

Using the bullseye method, try to identify a primary and secondary persona for Fluid personas.  Focus on the 0.4 component initially and then we can start to think about whether the primary and secondary change with new components (as we work on those components).

The goal is 1 primary but we may need a couple. &#x20;

Once decided figure out how to share the results with the community.  Do we need a wiki page that describes the process and rationale?  Do we want to talk about it at a design meeting?

Shared task between Allison, Erin, Daphne
