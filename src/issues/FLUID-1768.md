      "body": "This patch includes a successful upgrade to SWFUpload 2.2.0 beta 3, which is required for Flash 10 support. However, SWFUpload 2.2 also includes a bug in the callFlash() function that causes it to completely break when used with Flash 9.\n\nAs a result, this version of swfupload.js has been modified to include the old implementation of callFlash() as well.\n\nThis patch introduces a new decorator called the SWFUploadSetupDecorator, which is designed to setup the DOM and the SWFUploadManager correctly based on the environment.\n\nWhen it detects Flash 9, it swaps in the old implementation of callFlash() and ensures that the Flash movie isn't attached to DHTML buttons at all. When Flash 10 is detected, the Flash movie is instead attached to the Browse button.\n\nThis fix doesn't yet provide a fully workable Flash 10 implementation of Uploader, but it is the last step in the process. It should be identical in behaviour to the previous SWFUpload 2.1.0-based solution.\n"

I'm not particularly happy with the solution: at the moment, the \"Browse files\" is displayed as an image within the Flash move. There are two intolerable consequences of this:\n\n1\\. Increasing the text size of the page will not scale the button accordingly in IE, and in FF3 will cause awful visual quirks\\\n2\\. The button does not currently change its text to \"Add More\" when files have been added to the queu.\n\nTo use this patch, you'll need to add swfupload\\_f10.swf to your flash/ directory.\n"
