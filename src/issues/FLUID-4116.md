Uploader demo stops working when tried to upload a file. On IE 6 page shows the following errors:

Line: 844\
Char: 17\
Error: Exception thrown and not caught\
Code: 0\
URL: file://Y:\infusion-clean\src\webapp\demos\uploader\html\uploader.html

To reproduce make sure you have the right version of IE 6 with service pack1 running on Windows XP. Add your flash security settings then open the demo page.&#x20;
