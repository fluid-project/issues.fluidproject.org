When the volume slider is at maximum, using the mouse to drag the slider down is difficult because the volume menu closes as dragging commences.

To reproduce:\
1\. Open demo: <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>\
2\. Drag volume slider to maximum\
3\. Drag the volume back down\
4\. Notice that the volume slider will disappear as you drag downward.
