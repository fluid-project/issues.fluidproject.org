Whenever we have a dynamic grade that has an invoker in its defaults definition, that invoker does not get resolved against the actual component instance that the dynamic grade is attached to.

This is very relevant for cases where we want to have a conditional invoker based on some dynamic grade resolution process.

The test case is attached here: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/413>
