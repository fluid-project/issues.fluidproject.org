The engineers have a task to define the possible technical errors with uploading files.   This task should be paired with that one.  We want to think about what errors a user might encounter and then what they would want to do about them.  Based on user testing we will be bringing back fairly detailed descriptions of errors and would like to give users some appropriate action buttons.  So we'll come at this one from both sides.
