I tried to build `c2lc-coding-environment` on Node 12 on Windows 10 and got errors when:

* `npx flow`
  * I got approximated 100 errors saying that modules could not be found
* `npm start`
  * I got a warning about a module with the same same differing only in case

Unfortunately, I did not record the errors. But instead installed Node 10, which worked without error. I then re-installed Node 12, but no longer get any errors and I am unable to reproduce the errors that I was seeing.

In all cases, I was building the current `master` branch:

* <https://github.com/simonbates/c2lc-coding-environment/commit/1d617ec2c1559e71cfb755e72f20fc9fb79141ff>
