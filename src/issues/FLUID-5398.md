Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/>

2\) Upload a single file

3\) After the file has been uploaded, add at least two more files to the queue\
Notice that they also receive the complete styling (green bar to the left).

Note this doesn't happen if only one more file is added; however it will happen even if the two additional files are added separately.
