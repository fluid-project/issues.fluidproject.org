When cut & pasting text containing a newline character into an in-line edit field, the newline character is displayed as a single space without any wrapping. The text should be displayed on two seperate lines.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the in-line edit demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Open an in-line edit field in edit mode

3\) cut & paste the following text into the in-line edit field

"before newline\
after newline"

4\) press enter to leave edit mode. Notice that the text is displayed in a single continuous line with only a single whitespace sepererating what was two lines of text. Notice that in edit mode the new line character is also transformed into a single space.
