Steps to reproduce:

* Make a program with a loop and non-loop blocks, such as: startLoopA, forward, forward, endLoopA with 3 iterations
* Use High Contrast theme
* <https://develop-1-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.5&t=contrast&w=Sketchpad&p=sA3s11z&c=abb&d=&s=abb>
* Play the program and pause on either the startLoop block or one of the movement blocks
* Focus the block that the program is paused on
