In the language drop-down, consider listing each language in its own language. I.e. rather than using the UI language's exonym, use the individual langauges' endonyms, in their native writing systems. Could also list each in both its exonym and endonym such as "Japanese (日本語)"

This could be combined with efforts to provide autocomplete suggestions in the "other" text-box.
