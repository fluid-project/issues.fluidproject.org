In working on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-558#icft=C2LC-558>, I also noticed that the disabled add node buttons do not receive focus in Safari, but do in Chrome and FireFox.

I think we should discuss this and handle separately, as we need to agree on the expected behaviour.  As an example, we continue to have hover styles for disabled add node buttons, so they already appear like something you can interact with.
