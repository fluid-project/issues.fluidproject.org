In the case that IoCSS passes a source that is resolved as "undefined" into a subcomponent, meanwhile this subcomponent has a dynamic grade with a components block that needs to be merged. The undefined IoCSS source is taken into account at the components merging rather than being ignored.

The test case is created at: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/365>
