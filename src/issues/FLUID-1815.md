After cloning the "patterns\_by\_category" View for another feature, the patterns by category View no longer works properly without an argument.

Example:\
doing /design-patterns/10 would list all nodes under vocabulary ID 10.\
but doing /design-patterns/ would display a "No patterns found" message instead of all the design patterns in the library.
