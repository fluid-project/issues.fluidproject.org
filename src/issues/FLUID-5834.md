This issue can be re-produced by running the unit test - <https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245-demoFLUID5834/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/components/privacySettings/html/PrivacySettingsWithPrefs-test.html>

The test fails with the error:\
ASSERTION FAILED: Cannot resolve reference {arguments}.0 from component { typeName: "gpii.oauth2.editPrivacySettings" gradeNames: \["gpii.oauth2.editPrivacySettings","gpii.oauth2.privacySettingsDialog","fluid.rendererRelayComponent","fluid.commonRendererComponent","fluid.viewRelayComponent","fluid.commonViewComponent","fluid.standardRelayComponent","fluid.modelRelayComponent","fluid.commonModelComponent"] id: 7hpazkn5-307} which has been destroyed

The cause was because a couple of ajax calls set model values in their call back functions to the component, such as here: <https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245-demoFLUID5834/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/PrivacySettingsDialog.js>. However, at then, the component itself has been destroyed by the IoC testing framework.

The work around is to use fluid.isDestroyed() to check the existence of the component before setting model values.
