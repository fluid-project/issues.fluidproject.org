I looks like you can't drop it in front of the first one of any row.  My original thinking was that hopefully users wouldn't encounter this much.

We can assume there will be some ramp up time before anything gets released to users that is using the reorderer.  Hopefully we can get it fixed before then.\n* &#x20;Looking at the current list of jiras, I would put this one toward the bottom of the list of priorities and there seems to be plenty to do before the release.\n"

There are a number of outstanding issues:\n\n* the mouse move handler needs to be attached to the droppable when the drag gesture enters its space, and detached when it leaves ( the \"over\" and \"out\" options to jQuery.droppable().  I could not successfully remove the mouse-move handler on \"out\".\n\n- I used \"dojo.connect()\" to wire up the mouse-move listener.  We should switch to jQuery().mousemove() to be consistent with the rest of the drag-and-drop operation.\n\n* I defined a new method,Reorderer, beforeOrAfter (evt, element), to calculate where the mouse was relative the width of the droppable.   The \"evt\" argument is a dojo event.  It should be a jQuery() event – see last point.  More importantly, beforeOrAfter() should be a method of the layout handler since it is the layouthandler that \"knows\" about the spatial properties of the draggables and droppables.  At present, this means modifiying GridLayoutHandler and LIstLayoutHandler.\n\nSolving all of these issues will take more time than is available for a 0.1 release; thus, moving this task to 0.2.\n"

Currently, the Reorderer's drag-and-drop implementation only allows dropping the dragged item to just after the item the mouse is over.  Using the lightbox as an example, dragging a thumbnail over any other thumbnail allows dropping after the "hovered-over" thumbnail.  In particular, that means one cannot drag a thumbnail to a position before the first one.

The is very likely incorrect from a user experience point of view.  I can think of a technical fix, but I don't know if this constitutes a blocker for the 0.1 release.
