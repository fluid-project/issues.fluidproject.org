The following report is triggered - \
fluid.fail("Error in applyInstantiator: user instantiator supplied with id " + userInstantiator.id \
\+ " which differs from that for currently active instantiation with id " + existing.id);\
}

We actually need to move back to the historical scheme of maintaining an instantiator stack in parallel with the execution stack, if we want to continue with the facility for restoring a "local" instantiator across an event boundary, which we probably do. This created a problem with UIOptions/videoPlayer integration as an event dispatched from UIOptions model update to an invoker within the videoPlayer which resulted from a separate instantiation. This has probably never been seen in CSpace since it follows a more "modern" model of using a single instantiator throughout.
