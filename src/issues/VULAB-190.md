We need to create a zip file for vulab (web specifically for this issue) to allow for some testing.

I will pull the latest from the svn (and I'm going to manually include the readme as the readme patch is still doing its rounds)

Now its time to get it out there to some testers!

Please note that for designers out there we could use some interface and usability testing as well!\
