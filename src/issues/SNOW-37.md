The ministry branch has changed its name and needs to be updated under the logo-ing in the footer. "Provincial Schools Branch" is now "Provincial and Demonstration Schools Branch". The line in the footer should read:

SNOW is a project of the Inclusive Design Research Centre, funded by Provincial and Demonstration Schools Branch, Ontario Ministry of Education.
