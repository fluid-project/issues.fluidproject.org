The "standard" workflow of fluid-publish is a bit fragile -&#x20;

i) it depends on the existence of a git remote named "upstream" - at the very least we should document this clearly, and, if possible, add a CLI task that can take this as a copy from an existing remote in order to assist the user

ii) if part of the workflow is already complete, the plugin will bomb out -&#x20;

$ node publish.js --standard\
fatal: tag 'v1.1.0' already exists\
child\_process.js:484\
throw err;\
^

Error: Command failed: git tag -a v1.1.0 -m 'Tagging the 1.1.0 release'\
fatal: tag 'v1.1.0' already exists

In cases like this there should be some assistance to the user in how they could get the task to run - perhaps a command hint that they could run to get the repo into a suitable condition

iii) It would be nice if the default behaviour of the plugin in all cases was to echo commands that it was executing to the terminal as an indicator of progress
