The problem is that the JAWS user does not know how to save an inline edit (see <http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-2652>). If you don't save an inline edit, a redo button will not appear. &#x20;\n"

After an Inline Edit is saved, JAWS does not announce the presence of an "undo" or "redo" button.\
-using the JAWS 'find' keystrokes does not discover undo or redo
