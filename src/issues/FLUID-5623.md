The ToC for the tutorials section is missing documents. The problem is when someone navigates to a tutorial doc using one of the tutorial landing pages, it's unclear where they are in the hierarchy.

Solution is to surface these missing docs to the ToC and create sections like how it is done with the Renderer section.
