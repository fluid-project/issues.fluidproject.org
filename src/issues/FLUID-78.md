jQuery UI's drag-and-drop (Sortable) does not work with the "original" uPortal tabbed navigation example.  This is caused by the presence of nested floating elements â€“ see "#tab", "#tab a", and "#tab a span" selectors in "spring\_standard.css".

Although the following url is about the interface.eyecon.ro sortable extension to jQuery, it contains a note about passing a helper css class when the sortable elements have a float style.  The note is just below the table of options:\
<http://interface.eyecon.ro/docs/sort>

This proved relevant to jQuery UI's drag-and-drop.  See the branch FLUID-67 where this helper class technique was implemented successfully.
