Reset the central model to the default which resets \"speak text\" to false and \"words-per-min\" to its original value. This should also triggers the model relay for the \"Words-per-min\" prefs value to be relayed to \"Words-per-min\" text field slider;\\\n2\\. Resetting \"speak text\" prefs to false results in the destroy of its conditional panels including the \"words-per-min\" text field slider. A refreshView() is called right after the destroy to stop showing these conditional panels - <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5552/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L334-L340>\n\nThe debugging log shows the destroy of the \"words-per-min\" text field slider (line 337) happens before the error occurs. So it seems even though the text field slider should have been destroyed, the model relay onto it continues to happen.\n"

The core Infusion Framework uses the new model relay functionality, but the Prefs Framework still uses its own model relay framework. This makes upgrading the video player rather complicated.
