The selector mapping code inside fluid.engage.renderUtils.createRendererFunction() has a bug in it. If you directly pass it a component's live options.selectors object, as well as a set of selectorsToIgnore, it will actually remove each of those selectors from the component's options, causing its DOM Binder to break as well.

The reason this happens is because the code doesn't make its own private copy of the selectors before deleting properties from it. Ack!

Here's the offending code:

fluid.engage.renderUtils.selectorMapper = function (selectors, options) {\
var map = \[];\
options = options || {};

if (options.selectorsToIgnore) {\
selectors = fluid.engage.renderUtils.removeSelectors(selectors, options.selectorsToIgnore);\
}\
...\
return map;\
};

fluid.engage.renderUtils.removeSelectors = function (selectors, ignore) {\
$.each(ignore || \[], function (index, selectorToIgnore) {\
delete selectors\[selectorToIgnore];\
});\
return selectors;\
};
