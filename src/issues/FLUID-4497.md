Ensure your IE6 has flash installed and javascript enabled so that the multi file uploader will be loaded. This issue is with multi file uploader.&#x20;

1\. Open image gallery demo with IE6 - <http://build.fluidproject.org/image-gallery/image-gallery.php>\
2\. Issue #1: The div of section "Uploaded images" shows up as a line without any height, rather than an empty square box\
3\. Upload one or a few images with multi file uploader\
4\. The uploaded images are displayed in original size rather than a scale-down size.

It seems the css classes used to define the size of the div and uploaded images are not taking effect.
