Dr. Peter Coppin, Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Design, is a\
designer, visual artist, and cognitive scientist. His work seeks to\
improve information access through a better understanding of how\
individuals make use of their diverse perceptual-motor capabilities to\
interact with interfaces and other designed artifacts (such as diagrams in\
problem solving or sonic interfaces to financial charts and graphs).

Dr. Coppin¹s work is informed by his career journey, which cuts across\
engineering, design, and the visual arts. Dr. Coppin has authored numerous\
articles that focus on the perceptual-cognitive aspects of information\
interfaces with applications in diverse areas such as diagrammatic\
reasoning, research on dyslexia, learning technology, telescience,\
human-robot interaction, and data analytics. His work with government\
agencies and industry has included numerous projects related to the\
visualization of complex Earth and planetary datasets for NASA. Recent\
work tackles the challenge of accessible data analytics: Interfaces that\
enable low vision or blind individuals to access charts and graphs without\
visual perception.

Dr. Coppin¹s work has been funded by multiple NASA programs, the US\
National Science Foundation, the Heinz Endowments, the R.K. Mellon\
Foundation, the Buhl Foundation, the Laurel Foundation, the Center for\
Innovation in Data-Driven Design, the Ontario Ministry of Training and\
Colleges, MITACS, and NCE GRAND. Dr. Coppin¹s work in electronic media\
art-design has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including\
Prix Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria), the SIGGRAPH Touchware Exhibition\
(Orlando, Florida, USA), MIR: Art & Space (Bolzono Italy), and the Adler\
Museum (Chicago, Illinois, USA).
