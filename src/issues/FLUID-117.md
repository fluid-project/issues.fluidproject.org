In the context of the lightbox, single item selection could be accomplished by clicking on a thumbnail's \"dead\" space.  However, if the entire thumbnail triggers the link, then single selection would have to be accomplished by either (a) encircling it, or (b) shift-click.  Neither is as straight forward as just clicking on it.\n"

A mouse press and hold, to drag an image, does not show any indication that the image is now able to move. The user has to attempt to move the image to realize that it can be dragged. The pointer could change from a pointing finger to a closed fist to indicate that the image has been grabbed.
