On <http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>, if you edit the Announcement title, the undo icon does not appear (as it should). See attached screenshot.

The undo icon should be right next to the item that was edited, as specified in the "Change Section name" scenario on this page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Simple+Text+Inline+Edit+Storyboard>.
