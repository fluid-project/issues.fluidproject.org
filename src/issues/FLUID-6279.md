The line-space enactor will set the default multiplier to 1.2 ( <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/line-height>Â ) when it detects that the initial line-height is set to "normal". However, because the 1.2 is it universally accurate, this may cause some movement of the text on a site when the inline line-height style is set.

This was first noticed on [https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca](https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/)

When a line-height multiplier is not found we should either not set a line-space style or set it back to what was found in the document (e.g. "normal").
