Steps to reproduce:

* Create a program with a loop
* Turn keyboard shortcuts on
* Place focus on a loop iterations text box
* Play the program using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+p)
* Wait for the program to complete

Expected:

* Focus is on the loop iterations text box, where it was before running the program

Actual:

* We see the outline on the loop, but no focus indication on a block
* Focus is between the start loop block and the loop iterations text input: pressing tab focuses the text input, pressing shift tab focuses the start loop block (on Chrome)
