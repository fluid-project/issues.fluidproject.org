Declutter the sidebar to improve usability of the OSDPL, while preserving key functionality.

Example:\
Put a "My Options" link in the top-right corner and remove "My Options" from the sidebar. Move "Recent posts" out of "My Options" to be visible at a glance (i.e. without having to go into My Options to see them).
