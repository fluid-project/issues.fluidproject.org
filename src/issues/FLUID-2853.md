In Mac OS X, if you edit the file name directly in the Finder and remove the file extension, it doesn't actually remove it. It just enables Finder's \"Hide extension\" option for the file.\n\nTo fully remove a file extension on the Mac, choose Get Info, remove it the name, and you'll get a confirmation dialog asking if you really want to remove the file extension. When I do this, Uploader reflects the correct file name, sans extension.\n\nCan you double-check this and close the issue if you can't reproduce as well? After that, if you're still feeling indignant, maybe send a note to Steve Jobs? ðŸ˜›\n"

If you add a file to the file queue that doesn't have an extension that matches its file type, the Uploader adds an appropriate extension.

I'm not sure if this is a bug, and I'm sure some people wouldn't have a problem with it, but my first reaction was an indignant "Who are you to be renaming my files??" Is it appropriate for the Uploader to be doing this?
