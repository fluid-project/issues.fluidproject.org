Currently, the demo portal home page says\
"The following module are core features of Infusion, and not considered components"\
under the Framework heading, and \
"These components are available in the Infusion framework download" (with a link to the downloads page)\
under the Components heading.

This seems to imply that you can download the Framework to get the Components, which is confusing.
