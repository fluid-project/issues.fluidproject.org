Issue one: remove the "to" from the add node labelÂ when inserting a step between existing steps:

1. select move action
2. add it to sequence
3. add it to sequence again
4. Toggle on large Add buttons
5. Put focus on the + in between the two forward actions

Expected: "add selected action forward between position 1 forward and position 2 forward"

Actual: "add selected action forward to between position 1 forward and position 2 forward"

The "to" makes sense for the first and last + button (to the end of sequence/to the beginning of sequence).

Issue two: the label should be consistent with the audio feedback, should say "move" rather than "forward". Longer term, we will change the audio sample used for the audio feedback to say "forward" and use "forward" for the labels. But to be consistent for the presentation, we will change the label to "move" to match the audio sample.
