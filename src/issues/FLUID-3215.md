colinclark: So at the moment, the experience of our Builder is a bit raw in one area.\
\[1:09pm] colinclark: When you click the download button, you get what appears to be a new page, with a very subtle message saying something to the effect of "Your download will start soon..."\
\[1:09pm] colinclark: But it's hard to notice, and will confuse the user in its current form.\
\[1:09pm] colinclark: fj4000 has agreed to do a minor design tweak to that experience to make it awesomer.\
\[1:09pm] colinclark: I don't have a JIRA ticket for it yet, but it strikes me as a last bit of polish we want to include in the Builder.

Jacob has agreed to sketch out a design for Laurel to implement. This should be a simple bit of polish, not a large redesign.
