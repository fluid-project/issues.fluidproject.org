Two webhook URLs per repository would need to be configured â€“ the first one provided by Buildkite (for non-PR branches) and the second pointing to the proxy. The proxy would handle the GitHub account verification. If a recognized account was used to issue the PR then it wouldÂ [start a build](https://buildkite.com/docs/rest-api/builds#create-a-build) on the Buildkite side. If an unrecognized account was used then it would ask for confirmation using PR comments before starting a build. Seems clunky and brings us back to the scenario where we need to maintain this proxy and host additional infrastructure but so farÂ [all the CI options on the table](https://github.com/blog/2463-github-welcomes-all-ci-tools) seem to have their own clunky attributes.\n"

A `block step` for pull request branches will pause CI jobs. Buildkite fires [webhook events](https://buildkite.com/docs/webhooks) wheneverÂ [builds](https://buildkite.com/docs/webhooks/build-events) take place for any projects in an organization. One can [specify](https://buildkite.com/organizations/fluid-project/services/webhook/new) to only have `build.finished` events fired. Then have the following handy:\n\n* Buildkite API token with `read_builds` and `write_builds` privileges\n* `fluid-bot` account name\n* `fluid-bot's` email address\n\nVerify the incoming payload has the following properties:\n\n* event: build.finished\n* build.blocked: true (due to the fact a block step was used for the PR branch)\n* build.url: \\<whatever url is sent>\n\nMake a `GET` request using the `build.url` value and obtain the job that has the `\"state\": \"blocked\"` and `\"unblock_url\"` properties. Issuing a request such as the following, using the `unblock_url` value, will resume the CI job:\\\nÂ \n\n```java\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <buildkite api token>\" \\ \r\n-X PUT \"https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/fluid-project/pipelines/fluid-infusion-test/builds/18/jobs/f65f9669-3e46-49b9-9ef2-e736f3fbd051/unblock\" Â \\\r\n-d '{\r\n    \"fields\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"fluid-bot\",\r\n        \"email\": \"fluid-bot@looool.biz\"\r\n    } Â  \r\n}â€™\n```\n\nÂ It's still a workaround until Buildkite implements a feature that makes processing pull request CI jobs less risky but at leas the advantage of doing it this way for now is that the webhook only needs to be set up in one location, in the Buildkite organization's settings area.\n\nÂ \n"

It would be great if Infusion PRs could be tested by CI. GPII's CI automation (and automated PR testing) hasn't been replicated for Fluid due to Jenkins limitations, namely:

* An unmaintained Jenkins PR builder plugin
* Buggy multijob plugin that doesn't honour timeout values
* A vast world of pain that is Jenkins plugins management

We've looked into GitLab CI which addresses the issues above and also provides nice features such as pipelines, simpler YAML job configuration files, pull-based CI agents, and a more pleasant UI. The main disadvantage with this option is that GitLab's CI offering is packaged as a larger offering meant to replace GitHub. They provide very limited GitHub repository mirroring which is triggered on an hourly basis. GitHub PRs can't be tested using just their software â€“ more information is logged in the [GPII-2473](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2473) issue.

Recently I came across [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/home#features), a CI service that addresses all of the Jenkins and GitLab shortcomings. They provideÂ [free accounts to open source projects](https://buildkite.com/pricing) so I set up a [test Fluid organization](https://buildkite.com/fluid-project). You will need to create an account and be invited to the org to see CI results. Here is an example of an Infusion fork's PRs and branch merges being tested:

* <https://github.com/avtar/testingz/pull/1/commits>
* <https://github.com/avtar/testingz/commits/master>

The config file used to test the above:

* <https://github.com/avtar/testingz/blob/master/.buildkite/pipeline.yml>

The disadvantages of using Buildkite are:

* Proprietary service which can't be self-hosted â€“ although hosting Jenkins or GitLab involves considerable on-going maintenance costs in terms of securtity issues, testing new releases, support, etc.
* Job failures and successes are shown in the GitHub UI but Buildkite accounts are required to view detailed CI results
* I don't think PR jobs can be manually triggered using a confirmation string such as "ok to test" but I've contacted their support team to verify
* They don't provide a contributor whitelist feature so anyone can open a PR, potentially containing malicious code, and trigger CI jobs

There might be a workaround for the last point. When Michelle sent a test PR a&#x20;

`BUILDKITE_BUILD_CREATOR="michelled"` environment variable was available to the Buildkite agent. A list of trusted GitHub account names could be maintained and checked against before running any jobs on the agent.
