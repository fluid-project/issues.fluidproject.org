drag and drop of element to top of list does not work when it should - avatar when let go rebounds to original position.\
This bug is not generated only by dragging the\
list item way above the list and then attempting a drop; even if I\
slowly move the item avatar upwards and drop as soon as the move\
indicator bar appears in the top position in the list, the drop does not\
work, it is simply impossible to move the item to the top position. So\
it would appear this problem is not a duplicate of the "Drop target\
appears when avatar not in a valid drop position" bug .
