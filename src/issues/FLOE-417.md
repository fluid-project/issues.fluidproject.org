Currently the first discovery tool is not supported in browsers that do not support the web speech api because of its self voicing feature. However, for browsers that don't support the web speech api, it should disable or remove the self voicing feature and continue to operate. The speak text and speech rate adjusters should still be present as these are for settings on the system that is being configured.
