When having a nested complex transform (such as the valueMapper) it destroys the array holding the inputPaths.&#x20;

In most cases we just pass around the array of input paths and expect that reference to hold (see:Â <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/136c58613cb218ceaafc0528b24f2175a780009f/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L404> ) when modifying the content which is all fine and dandy until one of these <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/136c58613cb218ceaafc0528b24f2175a780009f/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L413> come along. Apparently Array.concat returns a new array, which means that our previous inputPath array reference suddenly is no longer linked to the transformer object
