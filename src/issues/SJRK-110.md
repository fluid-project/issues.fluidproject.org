In the imageBlockEditor grade, the method to detect whether a user's device has camera capture capabilities (functionÂ sjrk.storyTelling.mobileCameraAware.hasMobileCamera) is simply checking the user agent string. This is neither reliable nor recommended, as a UAS could easily be spoofed, customized or otherwise altered. The current check also only works for UAS's that have "iphone", "ipad" or "android" in them, so it is leaving out many otherwise supported devices.

Investigate other feature detection techniques. (modernizr?)
