Add individual delete buttons for each block, and remove the selection checkbox. The delete block button will be placed at the top-left of each block, alongside the "reorder" buttons once <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-288#icft=SJRK-288> has been completed.

The "Delete block" button at the top-right of the tool will also no longer be necessary.

Note: this functionality was previously a part of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-358#icft=SJRK-358>
