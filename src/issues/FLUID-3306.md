Originally wrote the php code to have a single path to the "secure" php files - named this DISTANT\_PATH (builder.php)\
Assumed the includes for all other files would all be the DISTANT\_PATH directory.\
This seemed to work on my server installation, but then stopped working with a clean install, and instead all of the include paths in the "DISTANT\_PATH" directory were calculated in reference to the original calling code in builder.php.
