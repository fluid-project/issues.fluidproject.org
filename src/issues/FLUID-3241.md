Can only tab to the "Browse Files" button once

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Uploader demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/html/Uploader.html>

2\) Using the keyboard tab to the browse files button.\
Notice that there are two bounding boxes, a black and a yellow one.

3\) Using the keyboard tab around again, until you reach the "Browse Files" button a second time\
Notice that this time there is only one bounding box, a black one. Now you cannot use the keyboard to open activate Browse Files
