Examine current Wiki content and determine how that information will be used in the restructuring. Specifically, examine content pages and see what content will be used as part of the FAQ, Demos, etc.

A good way to approach this task would be:\
1\. create a new Wiki page for each left sidebar navigation menu items. \
2\. tag such pages as "Wikimania" (so it can be identified easily)\
3\. for each of those pages add links to existing Wiki content which are relevant to that menu item

Hopefully going through this process will help create a Table of Contents type page for those menu items.
