Add rules to our eslintConfig to check indentation.

I did a little experimenting this morning and the following seems like a good starting place:

```java
"indent": ["error", 4, {
    "CallExpression": {"arguments": "off"},
    "SwitchCase": 1
}],
```

See: <https://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent>

`src/serviceWorker.js` was generated by create-react-app and doesn't match our 4 space indentation. We may as well update its indentation as part of this work.
