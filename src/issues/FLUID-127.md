The draft Fluid 0.1 Release Page is located here:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1708071>\
Thanks to Barbara for putting it together.

It needs to be reworked a bit to better represent the features of the release (rather than our goals) and to reflect the package we are releasing it in (ie. we're not shipping a demo or binary version). This then needs to be added to our website content management system.
