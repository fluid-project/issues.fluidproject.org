Some of the buttons include (but are not necessarily limited to):\
Advanced search page: all search buttons\
Browse listings pages: 'actions' button

Some buttons have background images for colour only which are not removed by h-c themes, and so make them hard to see:\
Contribute page: launch button and submit button\
Resource summary page: most button
