As part of the review for FLUID-6710 the resolution of grab handles was found to be broken for some Reorderer demos. \
<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1069#issuecomment-1028092059>

This seems to have happened as a result of the factoring off of the special "local container" variant of the DOM binder that is now used only in the Uploader's FileQueueView and the Reorderer fluid.createLocalContainerDomBinder .

The fix is in the special-case branch for an empty selector - should read

```java
if (selector === "") {
            togo = userJQuery(thisContainer);
        }
```
