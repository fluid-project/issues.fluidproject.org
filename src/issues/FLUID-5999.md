On the [progress demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/progress/index.html) the "Restart the Demo" link is light blue on a green background; however, this does not pass WCAG contrast guidelines.

from tota11y:\
"The color combination #2199e8/#afddc5 has a contrast ratio of 2.06, which is not sufficient. At this size, you will need a ratio of at least 4.5."

a suggestion is to set the font colour to #006095
