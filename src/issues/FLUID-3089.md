If columns become stacked, can't drag item into lower column

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Layout reorderer quick start example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/standalone-demos/quick-start-examples/reorderer/html/LayoutReorderer.html>

2\) Adjust the browser size so that two of the columns are stacked on top of each other.

3\) Attempt to drag one of the moveable items into the lower column. Notice that it will drop at the bottom of the top column
