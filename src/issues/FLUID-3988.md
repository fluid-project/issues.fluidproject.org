To reproduce:

1\. Visit <http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>\
2\. Upload a set of non-image files around \~5-10MB each\
3\. The uploader progress bar rapidly goes left-right multiple times in a seemingly arbitrary way, and then finishes uploading far quicker than it should
