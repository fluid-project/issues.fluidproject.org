The aria-live announcement added in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-337#icft=C2LC-337> is not read out (at least on NVDA with Chrome) after running a program that leaves the character in exactly the same location and direction as they started.

If you run a program that results in the character finishing at exactly the same location and direction as they started (such as: forward 1, backward 1), then the character state is not read out (at least on NVDA with Chrome) as the aria-live text has not changed.

A potential fix could be to clear the aria-live text when we start running the program.
