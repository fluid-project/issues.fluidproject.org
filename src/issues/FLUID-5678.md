Suggestions for fixes as part of the WCAG 2.0 accessibility audit of the UI options tools

* Detailed description/instruction text for function of tools e.g. change size of site textÂ 
* Update header copy for consistency

Will be addressed in FLUID-5738

* Wording for measure of scale with text size and line height as x Times may be confusing
