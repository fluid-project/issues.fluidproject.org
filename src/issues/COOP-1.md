The labour platform will be created in a flexible way so that individual cooperatives have the maximum control over how their platform works. The design will be created by an initial set of partner cooperatives using a co-design process.

The cooperatives who will be involved in co-design efforts include Tages Mutters, CoRise and SEWA [http://www.sewa.org/](http://www.sewa.org/,)
