This report will document the participation of the SIAT, SFU Team from June 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 (10-month period).  I will outline the lessons learned from a design perspective as well as provide a summary of the collective achievements such as the Ontological Studies, Journey Frameworks, the interface and physical kiosk design contributions.
