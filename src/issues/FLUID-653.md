Currently, shift-tab will put focus on elements in a previous module instead of putting focus on the module itself.&#x20;

To see this behaviour, use the uPortal example. Put focus on the 'calendar' portlet. Press tab - the title of the portlet now has focus. Press shift-tab - the 'Cancel' button of the 'bookmarks' portlet now has focus instead of the 'calendar' portlet itself.&#x20;
