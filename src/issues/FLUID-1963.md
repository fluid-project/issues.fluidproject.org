when you open the iFrame the selected settings are always the same, to start, no matter what the current style on the page is&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html>

2\) Click on the  "Edit Preferences" button

3\) Change the colour scheme, click on "save and Apply your Preferences", and click close

4\) Click on the  "Edit Preferences" button

Notices that the original styling options are selected not the current style's options
