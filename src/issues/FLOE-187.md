Research and create use cases for EPUB. Find out how people create and use EPUB 3 so we understand how best to write a guide.

For example, creators may be starting with content in a Word document and then creating EPUB 3 from that, or perhaps some sort of publisher workflow. Depending on their workflow, the Inclusive EPUB 3 guide will be different.

Another important question to answer is to uncover if there is a gap between the EPUB standard and what is being implemented in the workflow by content creators.

We need to find out what those workflows are so we can write more effectively.

Work should be documented on this wiki page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Inclusive+EPUB>
