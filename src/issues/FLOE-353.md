In Safari:\
When the user is viewing step 6 (i.e. the screen associated with the 5th icon, at the time of writing) and activates the 'next' button (either by clicking or by keyboard), the icons seem to scroll to the next set before the green checkmark appears, the the checkmark is left floating in the middle of nowhere.
