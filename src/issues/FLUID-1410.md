Currently they are linked from this page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Content+Management+Research+Models>. We believe the Fluid personas should now have their own page and any pages linking in to that page (e.g. <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Personas>) should be updated to link to this new page.&#x20;

The personas should be separated into Primary Personas, Secondary Personas, and "Auxiliary Personas" (the word "auxiliary" is a placeholder--feel free to come up with a better term if you can).&#x20;

We should also explain that all Fluid components are informed by the Primary & Secondary personas, and Auxiliary personas may be used in a particular problem space as necessary (e.g. we don't have a "Humanities" primary or secondary persona, but we may need one to inform our designs, e.g. someone like an Art History persona, if we are thinking about a space like reordering in an image gallery).

Primary Personas

* Catalina De Silva (Faculty - GSI Manager in Spanish)
* Christy Gonzola (Undergraduate Student - Molecular & Cell Biology)
* Ashley Myles (Undergraduate Student - Archeology)

Secondary Personas

* George McFadden (Online Instructor - Journalism)
* Stacey Pearson (Graduate Teaching Assistant - Microbiology)
* Anita Stalmach (Departmental Pedagogy Support - Instructional Designer)
* Andy Wright (Graduate Student - Information Studies)
* New provisional student persona - over-acheiver who takes a lot of online classes&#x20;

Auxiliary Personas

* Robin McCoy (Faculty - Business School)
* Ahmad Yousef (Faculty - Tenure-track History)
* Sergio Rossi (Graduate Teaching Assistant - Urban Affairs & Planning)
* Henry Sibley (Longtime Faculty - Chemistry, Provisional Persona)
* Shaina Wiseman (Graduate Student - Land Development, Provisional Persona)
* Michael Demsky (Departmental Support - Biology)
