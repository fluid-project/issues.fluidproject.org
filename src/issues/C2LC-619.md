When a program is running, the refresh scene button is deactivated, however, if you pause the program it is available again. This can be very confusing.

From co-design in March 2022:

* When a program pauses, the loop counter is not reset and the scene can be refreshed to take the character back to its original spot. Facilitators had to instruct students to fully stop the program first and then refresh their scene to ensure the loop counter is reset.
