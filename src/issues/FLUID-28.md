Currently it is difficult to trace errors and exceptions encountered in dojo-related code because we link against the compressed version of dojo. This compressed version is a single-line file that has been heavily squashed to save space.

We should link against the uncompressed version during development and devise a release process to automatically link our release builds to the faster, compressed version.
