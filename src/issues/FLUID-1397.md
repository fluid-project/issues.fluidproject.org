We would create a new subdirectory and host the latest release JS files there and create the appropriate index pages and decorations to make the demos appropriate as an outreach tool.\n\nTime estimate:\n\n* 1/2 day to set up the web space and to have files hosted and have basic demos.\n* 3/4 day for page design, instructions\n"
