Implement the UI for logging into the Storytelling Tool. This should include form validation and error feedback, much like SJRK-402.

The error message should be identical in either case of an incorrect password or username, to mitigate [username enumeration attacks](https://www.hacksplaining.com/prevention/user-enumeration).
