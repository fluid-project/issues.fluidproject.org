There were two instances of the eventBinder; one for pdfExporter and one for exportPoller. The fix was to use distinct names for each instance of the eventBinder and use a demands block to redirect the function call to point at eventBinder (e.g. decapod.pdfExporter.eventBinder -> decapod.eventBinder).&#x20;\n"

the exporter's startImport function gets triggered twice after the start export button is triggered. This is causing unit tests to fail (Decapod Export: imagePDF trigger onExportStart, Decapod Export: ocrPDF trigger onExportStart, Decapod Export: tracedPDF trigger onExportStart). Also on the live version, it attempts to upload twice, causing a "file is undefined" error to be thrown.
