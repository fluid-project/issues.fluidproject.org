When following the test plan for the dropdown inline edit, \
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inline+Edit+QA+Test+Plan+-+Dropdown>

choosing an item works inconsistently: sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't choose the option selected. There are no js errors or series of events that seem to recreate the problem consistently, tho I think it only happens when using a mouse.&#x20;
