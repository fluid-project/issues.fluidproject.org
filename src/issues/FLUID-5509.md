Any change request attempting to store a float NaN value into a model via the relay-aware applier will cause an infinite recursion in DataBinding. This is because the model will never be considered to have stabilised since each value always compares different to its original value via standard IEEE-754 comparison rules.

The simplest fix will be to adapt the fluid.model.isSameValue utility.
