We have recently discussed updating a least a few rules in our ESLint configuration.  These are:

1. **unused-vars**:  We have various unused variables scattered throughout the codebase.
2. **no-var**: We currently have a single use of var in [App.js](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/e632e93e8549a4fe814dd0440f005bba946a76f2/src/App.js#L226)
3. **prefer-const**: Quite a few examples of this, I thought I was the only one.
