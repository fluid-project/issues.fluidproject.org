Story Speaker (the audio preview) says things that aren't on the page like "keywords" (this is a known issue and Justin and I have been discussing a solution â€“ potentially using the Orator component instead of a fluid.textToSpeech)

Alternatively, this could be solved by passing parts of the current message string ("message\_readStoryText") in individual calls to queueSpeech.
