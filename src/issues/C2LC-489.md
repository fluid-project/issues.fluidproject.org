It isn’t clear that you are in a dialog after you click the “Share” button. There isn’t much content in the dialog and not much visual identification either. For an AT the dialog isn’t labelled either. It can appear that keyboard input is broken. You’d need to click away with the mouse or hit “esc” to quit.
