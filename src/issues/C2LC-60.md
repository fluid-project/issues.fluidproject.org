Instruct robots to collect objects such as balls and take them to a drop-off location - Users would use the coding environment to guide robots to a location where metal balls are available - Robots would have accessories attached to them that allow a magnet to protrude out or withdraw using commands given via the coding environment - The robots would be given directions to reach a drop-off area, possibly with obstacles in between

 

Details from co-design (Michelle):

Collect all the balls - Walk to pile - Pick up one - Walk to basket - Drop

 

Some work is in place since Dash can be controlled using the prototype
