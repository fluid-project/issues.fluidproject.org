* In the mobile layout, the line wrapping for “Inclusive EPUB 3” puts only the 3 on the second line, which makes it look strange.
* It's possible for a single letter to wrap and be on its own on a line.&#x20;

Example 1: in the ILDH, In the mobile layout the word “Introduction” is split across two lines with only the “n” being on the second line.&#x20;

Example 2: "Standardized" is also split across two lines.&#x20;

Example 3: Enlarge text size on a laptop sized browser window, on the side bar, 1, the one word title "methods" wraps into 2 parts;&#x20;

Example 4: The currently-selected flag (a vertical line) for the side menu item wraps into its own line. This doesn't happen with other side menu texts.
