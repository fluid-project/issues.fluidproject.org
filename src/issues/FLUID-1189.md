As discussed in our design framework meeting, for each component we want to create jira tasks that map to the framework.  We should use the inline edit tasks as a template creating clones of each of those tasks.

Then, any task that has already been completed should be resolved.  Subtasks should be created for each uncompleted task that will allow us to complete those tasks.
