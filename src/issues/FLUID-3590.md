Tabbing on a page with reorderable elements sometimes has inconsistent behavior. Depending on the combination of the integration and the platform, it may do one of at least the following:

* tabs forward through everything, including the individual reorderable elements, until the end of the list where it gets stuck; additionally, shift-tab will not go through the individual reorderable elements (just one element out of the group)
* tabs forward through everything, including the individual reorderable elements, until the end of the list, but through subsequent tabs will only go through one element out of the group of reorderable elements
* tabs forward through everything, but not the individual reorderable elements (just one element out of the group of reorderable elements), but shift-tabs will go through each individual reorderable element

To replicate, using Safari 4/OS X 10.5:

1\. Go to <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/listReorderer/html/listReorderer.html>\
2\. Tab forward till you reach the reorderer.\
3\. Try tabbing beyond the reorderer (it doesn't work). Try shift-tabbing to go into reverse (it will work).

To replicate, using Safari 4/OS X 10.5:\
1\. Go to <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/layoutReorderer/demo.html>\
2\. Tab forward till you reach the reorderer.\
3\. Keep tabbing forward (it will tab through the individual elements).\
4\. Keep tabbing forward more until you cycle through again (it won't go through the individual elements anymore).\
5\. Shift-tab to go into reverse (it will go through the individual elements).

To replicate, using Safari 4/OS X 10.5:\
1\. Go to <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/demo.html>\
2\. Tab forward till you reach the reorderer (it doesn't work).\
3\. Keep tabbing forward (it will tab through the individual elements).\
4\. Try tabbing beyond the reorderer (it won't work). Try shift-tabbing to go into reverse (it will work, but only goes through one element, not all individual elements)
