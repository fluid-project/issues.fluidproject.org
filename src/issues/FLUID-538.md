On WinXP:

Drop target appears when avatar not in a valid drop position,  happens with all drop targets. Unless the cursor is placed in just the correct position, the avatar will snap back to it's original location.&#x20;

On Mac OS 10.5

Drop target appears when avatar not in a valid drop position only happens for the bottom most drop target.
