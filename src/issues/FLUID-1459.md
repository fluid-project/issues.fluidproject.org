Use cases are more generic than scenarios and will create a list of generic requirements for the component.  We abstract from COUs & primary & secondary scenarios to start to see where diverse COUs and scenarios point to the same general use case. Primary and scenarios will have to be detailed in order to pull out the use case.

Use cases will feed into the functional requirements.
