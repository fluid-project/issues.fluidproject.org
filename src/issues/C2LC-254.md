"Error: buffer is either not set or not loaded"

The error only occurred on the initial visit to the coding environment, when I tried to play a program. The error got resolved after a refresh.

Steps to reproduce in Chrome:

1. Turn on Chrome network throttling in the Network tab of the Developer Tools (I used the "Slow 3G" setting)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Load the coding environment with a program: <https://develop-0-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=0.5&p=f3>
4. Click the Play button

Expected:

* The program runs

Actual:

* "Error: buffer is either not set or not loaded"
* I've attached a screenshot from Chrome with stacktraces and it looks like it's the AudioManager calling the Sampler
