Based on them and considering the overall impact on Fluid projects development, it is decided that a switch to Kettle will be initiated. As a start, the CherryPy server will be used for testing while Kettle interface is being developed.\n"

At the moment, Decapod server is less than 200 lines of code written in Python using the CherryPy web framework. It is inevitably going to need more work and investment put into it. While Python and CherryPy are both great technologies, we may want to consider using Fluid's Kettle server-side JavaScript environment to provide a simple and seamless development experience when creating RESTful services and even rendering markup.
