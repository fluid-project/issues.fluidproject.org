Once the infusion builder is deployed at the server, the directory and scripts for the deployment are wiped out. At the time that a new infusion release comes out and infusion builder needs to be updated to point to the new release, the only ways are either re-deploying the entire builder or manually replace the infusion and clean up the database.

We need a simpler and more formal way for this task.
