.docs-template-TOC-container  transition occurs on every page load, even when it is supposed to be hidden. The result is the user sees the sidebar open then close even if they had it hidden previously.

Ideally we would like the transition property on .docs-template-TOC-container to be applied after page load. This way the user will not see the sidebar expand and collapse on a page load.
