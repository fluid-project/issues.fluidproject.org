There is partial but not properly implemented or tested support in our "valueMapper" transform rule for matching on composite values. This needs to use a "scoring" system similar to the one used in the GPII's "canopy matchmaker" described at <http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4> and in other presentations.

Recent work on the metadata editing component by cindy has brought up a real use case for this, which can't be addressed in a compact and intelligible way through other schemes. This use case has been written up at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+valueMapper+Requirements>

There are some utilities "fluid.model.transform.matchValue" and "fluid.model.transform.compareMatches" which operate this, but they are quite vague and skeletal. It is time to press them into service for this real application - as well as ensuring that the inverse rule also works correctly.
