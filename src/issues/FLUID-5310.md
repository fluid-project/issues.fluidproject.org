In Safari, if you minimize the overviewPanel, it appears to disappear completely from the screen. But hovering over the top-left corner indicates that the component is still there and clicking will maximize the overviewPanel.

This appears to be a problem with the width of the hidden class being set to zero. Setting the dimensions makes the panel render properly.
