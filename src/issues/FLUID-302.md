As we've started to use Chris Hoffman's excellent jARIA plugin, we've noticed a number of areas where we can help to improve it:

1\) Fix a bug in role namespacing in FF3 (DONE)\
2\) There is no way to remove a state (e.g "activedescendent"). Perhaps a "removeState() method?

Other changes, as we discover them, could be added to this issue.
