At the moment, Infusion's model transformation framework takes a simple approach to specifying transformation using the following forms:

\<output path>: {\
expander: {\
type: \<expander type>,\
inputPath: \<input path>\
\<remaining expander options>\
}\
}

and the shorthand:

\<output path>: \<input path>

However, for cases where the output path is determined by some aspect of the transformer itself, we need to support a form like this:

{\
\<output path>: \<input path>,\
expanders: \[\
{\
expander: {\
type: \<expander type>,\
inputPath: \<input path>\
outputPath: \<output path>\
}\
}\
]\
}
