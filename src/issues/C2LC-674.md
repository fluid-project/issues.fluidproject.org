Hover is currently indicated on with theme selector using an orange background for all themes. When we change theme, the buttons on the theme selector dialog are updated to match the new theme, but the hover styling is not updated. The orange hover is used for all themes. Change the hover styling on the theme selector to be consistent with the hover styling on the simplification dialog.
