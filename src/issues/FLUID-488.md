List elements on the scheduler test page\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/scheduler/scheduler.html>\
cannot be reordered via drag and drop using FF2. On drop, item simply returns to its original location, despite other elements of the move being supported (ie opening up of space for the moved item as you drag it). (Note: crtl-arrow movements do work.)

Addendum: this also holds true for the nested scheduler test page:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/scheduler/RSFStyleScheduler.html>
