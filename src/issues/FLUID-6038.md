Steps to reproduce:

1\. Open the [Uploader demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/)\
2\. Add some files to the queue\
3\. Upload some of the files and stop the file upload\
4\. Using the browser's developer tools inspect the 'x' and the 'âœ“' mark at the end of the respective file rows.&#x20;

Notice that they are both marked up as buttons with a `aria-label: "Remove"`. The files that were uploaded have `title="File Uploaded"` as well. However, the uploaded files cannot be removed as the click handler has been taken off. Unfortunately the button itself isn't disabled, so an AT will see this as a remove button and the user will think it doesn't work.
