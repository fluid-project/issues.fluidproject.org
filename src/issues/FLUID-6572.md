Currently we only deploy CI builds of Infusion (build.fluidproject.org). However, it would be useful to provide deployments of demos, examples, tests and etc for the stable releases. This would allow those looking at using Infusion to be able to understand what is available in the stable releases versus master and to compare functionality, performance and etc.

This would also be useful for when we release version docs, allowing for linking to demos related to those specific versions.
