The Infusion Docs sometimes reference Blog posts on the Fluid website. For example:\
<http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/latest/DeclarativeThisismInIoC.html>

Since the redesign of the Fluid Project website, the blog posts have not been restored. So these links from the docs will give a 404 at the Fluid Project site.

The blog posts should be restored.
