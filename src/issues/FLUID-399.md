When reordering elements with a precedence assigned to it. You are able to place them under movable elements that do not have a precedence assigned to them. That is to say you could have a column of elemens like this (precedence 60, no precedence, precedence 50, no precedence).&#x20;

It is also possible to move items of higher precedence directly below items of lower precedence, both with mouse and ctrl-arrow movements.\
