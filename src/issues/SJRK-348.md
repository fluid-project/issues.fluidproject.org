Steps to produce:

1\. start the website with the karisma theme;\
2\. open UIO to select a high contrast theme;\
3\. All images are still show colors without adjusting to the high contrast background/foreground colors; borders for text fields, grids become invisible; the content editor becomes invisible, etc.

These may not cover all issues with using high contrast themes. More thorough testing should be performed.

Attached screenshot is how the story editor page looks when a high contrast theme is selected.
