Allison will be identifying the current IA and all the content we have along with thinking about strategies for a new IA this iteration.  The 3 of us will then work together to define a new IA through card sorting or something similar.  Next iteration we'll create new tasks for digging deeper into the content of the UX Toolkit.\n\nFor this iteration. the goal for this task is to get rid any \"old\" information, particularly references to current group work that is no longer happening.  It would also be good to do some initial separation between the UX toolkity information and the infromation about walkthroughs the Fluid team has done.&#x20;\n"

We should think of this as a first pass and perhaps putting together an overall plan for what we want to do for 0.6.
