Create a user testing protocol based on the previous version (but with less emphasis on date picking) to test two versions of the Time Picker: tabbed (paper prototype) and rolling (interactive prototype). Storyboard used in user testing last time should be updated and modified with tabbed time picker for this testing session.

Tasks likely to be include are the first four:\
1\. Enter a new assignment titled "Yellow Journalism."\
2\. The assignment should open on August 3rd, 2007 at 10:50am when class starts.\
3\. The assignment is due on August 17th, 2007 at 5pm.\
4\. You will accept the assignment until August 17th, 2007 at 11:59pm.

Plus, potentially a task that tests whether they know how to close the calendar if needed as they are entering data. And one task should test the 24-hour tabbed time picker.
