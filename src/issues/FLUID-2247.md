Therefore no event can be delivered as the first argument to the activateHandler - whereas a DOM element can. \\\nKicking this back upstairs - there seem to be only two options, i) continue with our current signature, and document even more carefully that the \"evt\" 2nd argument may sometimes be missing, or else ii) upgrade \"activate\" to be a top-level genuine jQuery event.\n"

As part of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2243#icft=FLUID-2243>, the return value of the activation handler was adjusted to agree with jQuery/browser defaults. Changing the argument list to also conform, that is, to consist of a single argument which is a jQuery event, should also be done, but was too significant a change for the 0.8 release. This needs to be done for 1.0, documentation, test cases and all samples updated.
