On the desktop we use ctrl-alt/option-r to reset the first discovery tool. However, on mobile it doesn't seem to be possible to bring up the onscreen keyboard without first navigating into an input field. A bluetooth keyboard may be able to be used, but it would be inconvenient and not guaranteed. Currently, a user would have to delete their browser cookies to reset.
