<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2308#icft=FLUID-2308> describes an issue with how the accordions bar and contents are displayed after a being hidden with display: none and then shown using display: block.

The proper way to get around this issue is to set the accordion options to {clearStyle: true, autoHeight: false}. Unfortunately, at this time, an error is thrown in IE with these options.&#x20;

<http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4100>

It is supposed to already be fixed in trunk, and should be available to use in jQuery UI 1.7

Changes that were maid in the temporary fix came at revision 6695
