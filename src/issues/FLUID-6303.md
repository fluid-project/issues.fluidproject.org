Typically when using the schemas, a primary schema is created that contains the potential values of a preference. For language this is problematic because each integration would have their own set of supported languages. It seems the best we can do now is to have the integrator configure the panel settings against the built prefs editor, that is after the schemas have been compiled and a  prefs editor grade is generated. Antranig, suggested that we could add a helpful utility for it.\n"

Implement a panel, adjuster and enactor for locale selection

The enactor need not be fully implemented. It could simply offer a point of integration that is left to the developer's discretion.

Some prior art in <https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery> (note that the page reloads every time the locale is changed in this project)
