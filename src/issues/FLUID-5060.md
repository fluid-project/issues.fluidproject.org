Jan Richards pointed out that UI Options should include a "low contrast" option in addition to the various high-contrast options, since it is common for people with certain types of vision impairments to want low contrast.

He also notes that user really should be able pick their own foreground and background colours, but that's another issue ðŸ™‚
