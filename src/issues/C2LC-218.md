Remove the "to" from the add node label when inserting a step between existing steps:

1. select move action
2. add it to sequence
3. add it to sequence again
4. Toggle on large Add buttons
5. Put focus on the + in between the two forward actions

Expected: "add selected action forward between position 1 forward and position 2 forward"

Actual: "add selected action forward to between position 1 forward and position 2 forward"

The "to" makes sense for the first and last + button (to the end of sequence/to the beginning of sequence).

This is a small change and has been done for the Closing The Gap 2020 demo:
