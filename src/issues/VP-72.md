The Video Player's current implementation of "full screen" mode is actually an attempt to maximize the video into the current browser window, not actually full-screen. If the browser window is a quarter the size of the screen, the code will simply attempt to fill the browser window. Even at that, it does not adequately take into account the video controls nor anything else that might be in the page (for example, the header of the demo page).
