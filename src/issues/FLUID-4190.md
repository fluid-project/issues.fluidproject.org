The capabilities of "produceTree" configuration lag behind those of the newly implemented lifecycle functions - when defined in component defaults, "produceTree" needs to be a direct function object rather than having the ability to dereference function names. It should ALSO be possible to define "produceTree" as an invoker - this is also not possible since the autoInit lifecycle does not call initDependents until after the component init function returns. For example, the following code:

fluid.registerNamespace("fluid.uiOptions.controls");

fluid.defaults("fluid.uiOptions.controls", {\
...\
finalInitFunction: "fluid.uiOptions.controls.finalInit",\
produceTree: fluid.uiOptions.controls.produceTree\
});

fluid.uiOptions.controls.produceTree = function (that) {\
var tree = {};\
var radiobuttons = \[];\
...

fails to correctly register the produceTree method so it can be recognised by the rendererComponent lifecycle
