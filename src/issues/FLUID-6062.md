As part of the review for pull <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/103> documenting some features which are new for the Infusion 2.0 release, @jobara suggested that we might want to adopt a particular styling for features which are new in a particular framework release, together with a workflow for removing this styling once the subsequent release has appeared.

In general we need to start versioning our docs properly as well (this was always the plan, given our URL structure, but has never been implemented) so that docs for each historical release can be accessed cleanly, as with, for example, historical versions of the node.js API at links like <https://nodejs.org/docs/v4.6.2/api/>

We should take up the styling issues with the design team, and work on the improvements to our scripts together with the work required on our docs platform at <https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5823>
