At the moment, the Infusion Builder doesn't clean up its temporary files. If the server doesn't already clean up /tmp, we should create a script and cron job to do so.

Investigate cleaning up the /tmp directories - expiring the info via nightly cron job.\
A good command to do this would be\
find /tmp/build/\* -type f -cmin +1440 -exec rm -f {} \\;\
find /tmp/products/\* -type f -cmin +1440 -exec rm -f {} \\;

Will also need to make sure that the permissions work so that this cron job can delete files created by nobody.&#x20;
