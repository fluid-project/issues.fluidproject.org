The jQuery # selector will interpret any special CSS selector characters, such as . or :, as part of the selector. So for example, a query like this will fail unless the id has been escaped first.

\<div id="foo.bar" />\
jQuery ("#foo.bar");

On the other hand, the following selector will work without requiring the id to be escaped first:

jQuery ("\[id=" + "foo.bar" + "]");

The latter selector is probably simpler and easier to implement. Let's use it ubiquitously throughout the Reorderer
