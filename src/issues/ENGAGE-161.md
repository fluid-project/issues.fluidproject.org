A variety of wireframes within Engage require a persistent navigation bar that includes both the ability to move backwards within a navigation sequence, as well as the ability to change UI state in different ways (eg. toggling between grid and list view, etc.). We need to create a component that interacts with the Screen Navigator, and can be used by other components, to provide an easy-to-use persistent navigation bar within Engage.
