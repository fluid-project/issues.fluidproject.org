User has no idea about content changes when using write toolbar buttons or shortcuts. Hence there is no way for user to know if the content modifications worked at all. And even if they worked there is no way to know what they have done to the content.

Shortcuts have the same behaviour, users can press shortcuts multiple times and have no idea if anything has happened in the content or to OER Resource overall.
