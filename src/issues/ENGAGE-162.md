As part of implementing the My Collection feature of Engage, we'll need to work out a reasonable data model for personal collections and users within the system.&#x20;

Going with the document-oriented JSON approach offered by Couch, I assume that users will be a separate document within the system. For collections, I expect it will probably be as simple as an object which associates a user ID with an array of collection names in the system.
