Add a maximum width to the "Learning Reflections" theme of the site, paying special attention to the display of saved stories.

Latest designs (at time of filing) have 1280px as a page width, presumably on a 1080p screen, so this seems like a reasonable overall maximum width.

Stories should also have their line spacing increased. Discuss the precise details with @@Caren Watkins
