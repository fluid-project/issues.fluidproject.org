Earlier this year, Flow introduced a new architecture known as "Types-First":

* <https://medium.com/flow-type/types-first-a-scalable-new-architecture-for-flow-3d8c7ba1d4eb>
* <https://flow.org/en/docs/lang/types-first/>

We are currently on Flow version 0.133. Types-First is enabled by default in version 0.134.

It is possible to disable Types-First with the following option in `.flowconfig`:

```java
types_first=false
```

One area that is going to need particular attention is `react-intl`. We are currently on version 3. The latest is version 5. And the Flow types haven't been updated since version 2:
