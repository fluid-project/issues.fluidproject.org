As with the rest of our infrastructure, we'll want Ansible playbooks for bringing up the cluster (and eventually, managing it) on CentOS.

There is a set of Ansible playbooks in the 'contrib' repo of the Kubernetes project that may be a useful starting point:\
<https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ansible>

Our initial staging setup will look like the following:

* 2 masters
* 5 nodes

â€”

*Comments retained from discussion of Atomic Host*

There are some caveats when using these playbooks with Atomic Host, some of which are detailed at: <http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/09/clustering-atomic-hosts-with-kubernetes-ansible-and-vagrant/>

I've also worked on a set of my own as part of my experimentation: <https://github.com/waharnum/kubernetes-atomic> - this started out as an Ansible-based implementation of the instructions at <http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/gettingstarted/>, but expanded to also configuring DNS, persistent storage and a number of example services and pods
