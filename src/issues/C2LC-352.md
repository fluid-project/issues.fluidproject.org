When the program is running, various buttons and toggles are "disabled" temporarily, including:

1. The scene refresh.
2. The "delete all steps" icon.
3. The "world picker".
4. The character position controls.

 

All of these do not change their appearance when they are "disabled". This is fixed for the character position controls in the pull for C2LC-332, the rest need to be fixed as well.

 

All of these except for the character position controls still show hover styles when they are disabled.  We need to update to either add a ":not" to exclude the disabled class from the "hover" styles, or to add styles to the "disabled" classes to avoid showing the hover colours.
