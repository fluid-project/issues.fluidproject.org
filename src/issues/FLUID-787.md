Due to recent issues regarding the size of the Wiki (including a failed upgrade on Jun 18 and a quota problem in May '08), the size of the Wiki should be diagnosed to determine what is occupying disk space and to figure out if there is a way to compress / optimize / minimize that foot print.

Ultimately we want the Wiki to be smaller for improved reliability of service.
