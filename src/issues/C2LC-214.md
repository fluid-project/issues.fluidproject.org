Environment: Windows 10, NVDA 2020.2, Chrome 84

Steps to reproduce:

1. Launch NVDA
2. Open <https://develop-0-3--c2lc-build.netlify.app/> in Chrome
3. Tab to the command palette and select the Forward tile
4. Tab to the program area Add Node
5. Press Space to add a Forward tile to the program
6. Press Space to open the Control Panel
7. Press Space

Expected:

* The Control Panel to close and focus to remain on the Forward tile (this is what happens when NVDA is not running)

Actual:

* The Forward tile is deleted

Something funky is happening with the focus: I also notice that if I press Tab after opening the Control Panel, focus moves to the Delete button (as expected, but “Delete” is not read, though it is if I Tab to Replace and Shift-Tab back).

Other cases observed:

* Pressing space with focus on a tile is adding a new tile, instead of opening the Control Panel (like focus is on the Add Node)
* It looks like focus is on the final Add Node, but pressing Space (with a command selected in the palette) does not add to the program. Sometimes it moves focus to the Play button.
* It looks like focus in on the Add Node, but pressing Space is opening the Delete All dialog

Hypothesis: NVDA is maintaining focus independent from Chrome and it is getting out of sync, it is missing focus updates. I haven’t seen these issues without NVDA running.
