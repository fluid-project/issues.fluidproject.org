Steps to Reproduce:

1\) Open the UI Options demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/>

2\) Open the display preferences and enable Table of Contents\
The Table of Contents should display correctly on the page

3\) Hide and re-open the display preferences\
Notice that there is an error in the console because the ToC template couldn't be found

UIO has a tocTemplate option that works for the main content, but doesn't seem to be passing it along to the enhancer used in the separated panel.
