For example:

 

* “Move Step 3 forward 1 square into loop A”
* “Move Step 1 forward 1 square out of loop A”

 

For other cases, we include the direction, such as: “Move Step 2 turn left 45 degrees before step 1 forward 1 square”

 

What we want:

 

* “Move Step 3 forward 1 square into the beginning of loop A” \[move right into]
* “Move Step 3 forward 1 square into the end of loop A” \[move left into]
* “Move Step 1 forward 1 square out before loop A” \[move left out of]
* “Move Step 1 forward 1 square out after loop A” \[move right out of]
