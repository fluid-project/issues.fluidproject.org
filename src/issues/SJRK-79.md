I.e. if nothing has been uploaded/chosen yet, it remains such, but if an image has been uploaded/chosen, it stays and is not cleared away.\n"

The Image block single image uploader won't clear a previously chosen image's preview when the uploader control is opened and then canceled. This means that the manual image block editor tests are failing (step 6 in the sequence).

Two possible solutions:

1 - find a way to fix this bug in Edge

2 - if the expected behaviour is not actually desired, simply remove the code for it
