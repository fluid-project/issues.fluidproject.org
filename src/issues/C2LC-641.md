With update to [C2LC-620](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/pull/356/files#diff-8b405185cf370674ff4234ccb82e34297c22bea300e2468c96c026840d2c520bL377), the character reference we used to auto scroll the scene has accidentally removed and that resulted in breaking the auto scroll behaviour of the Scene.&#x20;
