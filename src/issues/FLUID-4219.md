This prioritySpec, used with the CSSGenerator, should do the trick:\n\ngenerator.prioritize({\\\n\"fluid-cssGenerator-allRules\": \\[\"font-size\", \"line-height\", \"font-family\", \"color\", \"background-color\", \"background-image\", \"border\", \"background\"]\\\n});\n"

The that.stylesheet object in the CSSGenerator.js file has a value, however the that.stylesheet.cssText seems to be null.\n\nHere's what's left:\n\n1\\. Squash the bug above as described.\\\n2\\. List the stylesheets that need to be transformed in the build.properties file and load them (currently hardcoded for testing)\\\n3\\. Uncomment the code in StylesheetImportant.js to generate the transformed stylesheet and write it to a file\\\n4\\. Determine the path of where to save the transformed stylesheets (for testing, the files are currently set to overwrite itself)\n"
