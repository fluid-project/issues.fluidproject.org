We now make efforts, where the \"cloning\" strategy use used to make the avatar, to set its CSS size to the original size - however, for this particular sample, the markup is organised in such a way that it does not respond to this width specification, this resulting in a mismatch between the visual appearance of the avatar and its actual measured size.

To reproduce - on the UPortal layout customizer - grab a wide portlet and drag - for maximum effect grab the portlet on the far right. While dragging the portlet will appear to the left of the cursor, quite a ways. This may be a function of a shrunken avatar. The cursor remains where the portlet would be if it had not shrunk.
