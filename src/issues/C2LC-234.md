This ticket covers creating an initial set of sound-producing components and a starting "soundscape" that provides cues about position:

1. Indicating the vertical position (row), perhaps using pitch and/or volume (i.e. lower on screen is closer to the player).
2. Indicating the horizontal position (column), perhaps using pitch or panning.
3. Indicating the scene boundaries, such as by changing the sound (low pass filter, reverb, lower volume, etc.) when the character is out of the scene.

We may choose to split this up into two tickets, but I also feel like at least a few "actions" should be sonified, which gives us baseline sounds to "pitch" and "pan".  Possible actions to sonify include:

1. Idling (not moving)
2. Turning
3. Movement (while not drawing)
4. Movement (while drawing)
5. Movement while offscreen (as an effect modifying either of the above).
6. Colliding with the scene boundary.
7. Lowering the Pen
8. Raising the Pen

In preparation for having multiple characters or allowing users to choose the sounds they prefer, we should make each of these configurable, perhaps by defining a collection of sounds as a "theme".  This should probably be handled once we have more characters or things to interact with onscreen, but we can at least discuss it a little and leave a few TODOs.
