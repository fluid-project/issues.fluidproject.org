The video web address entry field label currently reads "Web address for video".  This should read "Enter web address for video" to ensure that screen reader users understand that an action is required.  Also, the captions web address entry field labels currently read "Enter web link to caption".  For consistency these should be changed to "Enter web address for caption". &#x20;
