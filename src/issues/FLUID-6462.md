## Describe the bug

The page at '<https://fluidproject.org/>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure stylesheet '<http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Slab:400,300,700,100>'. This request was blocked since the content must be served over HTTPS.

### To reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '<https://fluidproject.org/>'
2. Right-click and Click on Inspect.
3. Go to Console
4. See error

### Expected behavior

The API call should not be blocked

## Technical details

http is not secue and https calls must be based since the base host i.e. fluidproject.org is using https connection and api calls to http cannot be made.
