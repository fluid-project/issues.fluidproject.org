In recent pairing with Sepideh Shahi, she asked about the vertical alignment of the inner circle in our toggles.  This is only centred vertically for some text sizes (see screenshots).  First, at 100%:

Now at 110%:

Now at 125%, where the alignment seems OK:

I suspect there is some non-relative unit specified that causes the inner circle's alignment not to work for all text sizes.
