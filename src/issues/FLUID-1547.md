Drop target in wrong location when column only has a locked portlet

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Move all of the movable portlets from the left column to the right

3\) Attempt to move a portlet from the right column back to the left

Notice that if you are lower than where the drop target would appear, the drop target is placed back into the right column.
