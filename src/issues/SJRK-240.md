The browser tests are not accessible on the staging site after merging the pull request for SJRK-224: <https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/pull/34>

If tested locally, they are accessible at <http://localhost:8081/tests/>

Expected:\
The same tests should be accessible at <http://staging-stories.floeproject.org/tests/>

Actual:\
The server response is

```java
{"isError":true,"message":"Cannot GET /tests/"}
```

The same issue exists for the "binaries" folder (located at \tests\binaries\ in the source)
