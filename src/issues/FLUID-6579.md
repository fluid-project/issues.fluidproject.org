I was testing a PR out locally last week and also noticed an anomalous drop in coverage in one run. I have a suspicion that this might be caused by some of our conditional tests randomly not running. For example the text-to-speech system has a condition to [check if TTS is supported](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/main/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeechTests.js#L22-L62) in the browser. In this case it might be timing out on some runs; thus dropping the coverage report.\n"

CI for <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1036> failed because it claimed there were changes in TextToSpeech.js and Orator.js which there were not.
