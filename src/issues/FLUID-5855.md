Per a conversation Michelle and I had, the Infusion README (<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/README.md>) could use tweaking in other places.

* under "What Is Infusion", it would be good to expand on
  * what makes Infusion "a different kind of Javascript framework" compared to other Javascript frameworks those new to Infusion might be familiar with
    * what makes Infusion "accessible" / supports its use in building accessible software
  * Different ways infusion might be of interest to different audiences (someone who wants reusable accessible web components vs. someone who wants to build new components is one example of this)
  * the pieces that make up Infusion&#x20;
    * the core IoC framework
    * the reusable web components built using that IoC framework
* "Where Is Infusion Used" could be expanded - the <http://fluidproject.org/projects.html> page is probably not as current as it could be.&#x20;
