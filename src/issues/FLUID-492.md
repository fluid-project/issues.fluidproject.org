Since many (perhaps most) screen reader users will have no idea that this may be the source of their problems, or know how to resolve it, it is critical that they be told that \"Screen reader users must turn off the Virtual Cursor (ins + z)\" for Lightbox to work.

In each of the environments listed, it was difficult to exit JAWS Virtual PC Cursor in order to use the I,J,K,M keys to navigate through the available images.\
Ordinarily one enters \<INS>z to drop out of the JAWS Virtual PC Cursor and in this case should simply be able to use the designated keys for navigation. In most cases it was possible to get around this by 'playing' with the arrow keys and then going back to the provided navigation keys.
