Steps to reproduce

1\) Open either of the Full page UIO demos\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FullNoPreviewUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FullPreviewUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>

2\) Change the Line Spacing and save the change\
Notice that the line spacing didn't change.

Note that linespacing works in the preview window, and also for the Fat panel version of UIO.
