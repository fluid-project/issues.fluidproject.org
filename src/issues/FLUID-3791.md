In implementations where inline editable text has an associated label, the label should be clickable to activate the inline edit field. This is similar to how web forms should behave: clicking on the label should put a focus / edit cursor inside the associated text field.

The interaction makes sense and visually obvious, however how is this interaction expressed properly through markup to maintain accessibility since inline edit implementations are not traditional text fields?
