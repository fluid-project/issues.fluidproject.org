One way involved running the examples with Orca on GNOME/Linux.  The other was to see what events FF was emitting on Win7, using AccProbe.\n\nFor the GNOME/Linux tests, Orca spoke a sequence of \"percent complete\" speeches.  That is, both examples worked.\n\nFor the FF/Win7/AccProble tests, a sequence of EVENT\\_OBJECT\\_VALUECHANGE events were emitted.  This matches the mappings spec (MSAA+IA2) for changes to aria-valuenow. FF is emitting the documented a11y events on Win7.  And, although not checked with an inspector, it's likely FF is emitting the ATK/AT-SPI events for the Orca tests.\n\n\\[1] <http://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/#mapping_events_state-change>\\\n\\[2] <http://www.oaa-accessibility.org/example/27/>\\\n\\[3] <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/progress/>\n"
