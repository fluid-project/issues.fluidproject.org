In FF3.6/Win7, clicking on a position on the scrollbar for the keyboard accessibility plugin demo does not move the position at all.

In IE8/Win7, the same action temporarily moves to the requested position, but is reverted back to the original position immediately afterward. If one clicks frequently enough, it will successfully move to the requested position.
