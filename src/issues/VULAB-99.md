      "body": "There is a class called MultiPartFormOutputStream that was available online as a code sample here:\\\n<http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=451245&forumID=31>\n\nI assumed that it was public domain software since it's available to anyone online and unlicensed.  Colin asked me to clarify with the author of the code.\n\nThis issue stems from the following email received from Colin:\n\nDavid,\n\nThanks for getting back to me. Comments below...\n\nQuoting David Makalsky \\<dmakalsky@gmail.com>:\n\nGood catch... I was going to follow up on this earlier, but I forgot.\\\nI found this code online at the location you mentioned, and as far as\\\nI could tell, it's a code example, or public domain code.  I think\\\nit's a free-for-all at this point.\n\nThe notice below the code is too ambiguous to interpret it clearly as being in the public domain.\n\nI will contact the author and take this on, no problem.  Also, I can\\\nalways rewrite the code.\n\nThanks, that's great. Let me know how it goes.\n\nAgain, my understanding is that if code is posted publicly with no\\\nlicense, its public domain.\n\nThat's not actually true. Any work is naturally copyrighted upon its creation. Releasing it on a forum doesn't automatically put it in the public domain; this is something that the author must do explicitly. While there's the hint that this code **may** be intended as public domain, there's no explicit statement to this effect. As a result, we need to treat it as copyrighted and not suitably licensed for use within Fluid.\n\nHopefully the author will be interested in sharing the code with us specific under an appropriate license, or confirming his intention to make it public domain.\n\nVULAB9\n"
