After the dropdown menu is expanded, user can only collapse it with the mouse by clicking outside the dropdown area or one of the options in the dropdown menu.

Specifically, the user cannot collapse it by clicking on the original dropdown element or on the dropdown button that appears when the dropdown is expanded.
