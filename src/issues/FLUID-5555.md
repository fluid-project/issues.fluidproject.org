It appears that both grunt-webfont and webfont-generator use <https://github.com/nfroidure/svgicons2svgfont> as the node engine, so perhaps tweaking the settings for grunt-webfont would get it to work.\n\nWe may also need to rebuild our svgs for the icons. For example use consistent art board sizes for all of them.&#x20;\n"

Currently in Fluid / Floe related projects, we are using an ad-hoc system to generate fonts: whenever a project needs a font, an existing icon font is duplicated, or another icon font is created from scratch. This creates a problem where icons are hard to maintain.

A possible solution (open for discussion and refinement):

* create a font project in github to store the SVG vectors used for font icons
* SVG files are not binary, so they can be versioned easily by github and still editable by vector editors
* use a grunt plugin capable of generating fonts from an arbitrary list of SVGs
* have an index file / contact sheet which shows all available icons.

There are some questions to address:

* How is it possible to maintain a font set for a particular project? i.e. Project A may use 10 of 20 fonts, whereas Project B may use 12 of 20. How is this information stored?
* How are Unicode PUA's specified for each glyph / SVG? Are PUA's globally unique in the font repository, or do projects define their own PUA's?&#x20;
* If someone deletes an SVG from the repository, do the PUAs change automatically?
* Can Readme documentation be automatically generated for each font set? The readme would contain instructions on how to use the icon font in CSS/HTML, and list the PUA codes for each glyph.
