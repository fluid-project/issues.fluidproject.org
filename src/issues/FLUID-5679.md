Suggestions for fixes as part of the WCAG 2.0 accessibility audit of the UI options toolsÂ 

A heading that introduces the component would be beneficial to users for the added context and organization. Ex. \<h2>Preferences Editor\</h2>, with the sub-headings then changed to \<h3>s.&#x20;

Table of Contents should be a H2 as H1 are generally reserved for site title or main titles.
