A runtime error is thrown when pushing in a direction where there is no column.

Error: 'cacheelem.position' is null or not an object\
Line 381: var retpos = projected.cacheelem.position;\
File: GeometricManager.js

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Tap the tab key until one of the portlets has focus

3\) Using the arrow keys move to a portlet in the left column

4\) Push the left arrow key. Notice the run time error

The same issue occurs if you push right from a portlet in the right hand column
