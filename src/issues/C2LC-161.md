Disabling all interactable buttons behind the modal component (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-112#icft=C2LC-112>) seems like a necessary work.&#x20;\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n* Load the Coding Environment\n* Turn on screen reader\n* Open a modal by either failing to connect to dash or by pressing delete all button\n* Use screen reader navigation key â€“ on VoiceOver (VoiceOver key + left or right key) on ChromeVox (Search key + left or right key)\n\nExpected: Interacting with components behind the modal shouldn't be allowed\n\nActual: You can interact with the coding environment behind the modal&#x20;\n"
