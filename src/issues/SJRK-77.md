Add the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the fluid-couch-config repository before merging it into fluid-project.

Contributor guidelines should be carefully reviewed and changed as required to fit the project as the one linked is merely a template. See GitHub’s “[Setting guidelines for repository contributors](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/)” help document for more details.
