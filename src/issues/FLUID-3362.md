The test cases for parsing Java-style properties file parsing have rotted in that they are no longer being invoked. This may be because of drift in support of the underlying testing framework for asynchonously (that is, not on the same stack frame as the issuing of the "test" call) issued testing assertions. The final test shown from "Renderer Tests" should be "Properties file parsing".
