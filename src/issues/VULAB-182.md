JohnC has been working with me for a couple of weeks now, and although he was in hiding he has been working diligently and the spoils of his labour have come to fruition.

He has created an AMAZING re-design of vulab, rebranded with fluid which gives us a VERY nice GUI to package vulab with for our 0.5 final release.

This issue is for getting his work into the SVN.

I will comment on what features this issue covers specifically, and what is to come, as we want to incorporate his changes based on feature sets.
