Wide gap between inline edit fields when in edit mode

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Sakia inline edit example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Activate one of the first two inline edit fields

Notice that the gap between the activated inline edit field and the one below it has increased in size.
