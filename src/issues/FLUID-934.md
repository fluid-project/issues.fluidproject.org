This will serve as informal user testing of the OSDPL. After entering the pattern into the OSDPL, we will then delete each design pattern from the Fluid wiki so the patterns only reside in one place. This task will be shared by Daphne, Allison, Erin, Jonathan, Paul and Gary--each of us will enter one design pattern.
