Steps to reproduce:

* Create a program with 2 nested loops
  * startLoopA, startLoopB, endLoopB, endLoopA, startLoopC, startLoopD, endLoopD, endLoopC
  * Give the loops some number of iterations (such as 3) so that it is easy to pause execution inside loop B
  * <https://develop-1-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.5&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA3ssB3szzsC3ssD3szz&c=abb&d=&s=abb>
* Play the program and pause execution when loop B is executing
* Place focus on the startLoopA block: the block has the focus indicator but the loop A does not
* Now place focus on the startLoopC block: the block has the focus indicator and the loop C does also
