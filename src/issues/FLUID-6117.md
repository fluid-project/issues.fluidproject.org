The current [Prefs Framework demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/) uses content and styling pulled down from an OER. Unfortunately it is not already responsive and contains rather complex markup and styling itself. We should either fix this demo, create a new one, or pull in some other example OER content that is already responsive.&#x20;
