The current fluid.allocateSimpleId(element) does not handle the case where "element" is undefined.  This function can be improved as follow:\
When the element is undefined, then return the "fluid-id-" + fluid.allocateGuid(); if the element is there, perform the old behavior.  We probably want to update the unit test as well. &#x20;

framework/core/js/Fluid.js line 1699\~1705. &#x20;
