To recreate this issue, look at an inline edit example with multiple inline editors on the page such as: <http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

Click on the first Inline Edit. Click in the text box. You will see that a different Inline Edit component has browser focus. Pressing enter right now will put the other Inline Edit into edit mode.&#x20;
