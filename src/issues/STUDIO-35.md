Joanna has found a couple more styling tweaks that she'd like fixed:

1\. Increase the font size on a single post page \
2\. remove the spacing between the title and the excerpt on the index page\
3\. move the login button to the sidebar as per the wireframes\
4\. only have a border along the bottom of UIO\
5\. change max width to be closer to the size of 3 columns\
6\. keyboard focus styling should be the same as mouse hover
