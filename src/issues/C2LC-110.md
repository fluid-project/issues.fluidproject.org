This happens when setting a step command block, when Adding a blank step and when Deleting a step.

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Activate the Forward command block in the command palette
* Navigate by keyboard to the first program step
* Press Space or Enter to set the Forward command at the first step

Expected: Focus to remain on the first step, which now has the Forward command

Actual: Focus is lost

Notes:

* See: <https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#programmatically-managing-focus>

 

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Activate the Forward command block in the command palette
* Set the Forward command at the first step
* Activate the Add editor action
* Navigate by keyboard to the first program step
* Press Space or Enter to insert a blank before the Forward command

Expected: Focus to remain on the Forward step (now the second step)

Actual: Focus is lost

 

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Make a program with: Forward, Right
* Activate the Delete editor action
* Navigate by keyboard to the first program step (Forward)
* Press Space or Enter to delete the Forward command

Expected: Focus is now on the new first step block (Right)

Actual: Focus is lost
