We would like i) for it to produce markdown, not HTML, and also it currently makes no attempt to parse our JavaDoc-inspired doc comments. This area of our API is extremely stable and it shouldn't be too much overhead to keep some manually generated pages in sync, as well as this allowing for more human curating of the content with some commentary and grouping of related APIs etc.\n"
