Do a comparative analysis/benchmarking of a few other pattern libraries (many of which can be found on this page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Pattern+Resources>) with the goal of creating a front page for the OSDPL that is more interactive. The main page should be a bit more engaging, showing prominent items that the user can interact with. A single line summary of what the OSDPL is about, and then a few interactive elements to reinforce that. Perhaps the information that's there now should be in a FAQ?

Potential ideas:

* create a visual like the web patterns library uses: <http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ui_designpatterns/webpatterns2/webpatterns/home.php>
* show short summaries of recent patterns like Yahoo! uses: <http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/>&#x20;
* We could also invite people to rate patterns, but I'm not sure if we want to require a user account to do this?
* "Recent Patterns" box
* a prominent Search or Tag cloud so the user can start browsing
* <http://ui-patterns.com/>
