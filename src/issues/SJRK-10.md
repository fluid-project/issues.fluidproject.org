We envision the Social Justice Repair Kit's storytelling tools to be expressive and multimodel, supporting the telling of stories using audio, video, text, images, and more.

Given this, we should implement a prototype of the components required to record audio stories.

Alan Harnum hasÂ [implemented a prototype audio recorder](https://github.com/waharnum/transcribingRecorder) that also includes the ability to transcribe voice recordings using the Web Speech Recognition APIs.

I have [refactored this implementation](https://github.com/colinbdclark/transcribingRecorder/tree/componentization) and am progressively adding new functionality such as:

* Context awareness for the Chrome-only functionality such as SpeechRecognition-based transcription
* Support for a Web Audio-based recording back-end that will have greater browser compatibility than the current MediaRecorder implementation

This prototype should completed, merged into a Fluid Project repository with the sjrk- prefix, and eventually integrated into the main SJRK storytelling repository (which doesn't seem to exist yet?).
