User enables system to follow their movements/actions e.g. body/head movements, wheelchair movements, etc. Then they can assign a meaning or command to it.&#x20;

* Requires access to camera&#x20;
* can turn on independent, parallel or interactive play&#x20;

Details from co-design (Justin): Parallel play: robot follows learner; learner follows robot. Interactive: Robot and learner interact and respond to each other. Perhaps a collaborative dance, art piece, game/sport. May also involve others. - Follow me option in the latest UX prototype design

Â 

Possible solutions 1. Low-fi design experiments (Wizard of Oz, Role Play) 2. Low-fi dev experiments&#x20;
