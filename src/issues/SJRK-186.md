The placeholder text in the text fields does not respond to changes in the UIO contrast themes. It is unclear whether it should, and if so then how.

To reproduce:

* Begin a new story
* Add any block
* Click "+ show preferences" at the top of the page
* Click one or more of the different contrast themes in the "contrast" panel of UIO

Expect:

* Unsure, perhaps that the placeholder text colour would change along with the rest of the page

Actual:

* The whole page changes and the placeholder text does not
