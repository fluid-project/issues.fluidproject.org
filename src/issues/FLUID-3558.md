In the image reorderer demo, fluid-infusion/src/webapp/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/html/imageReorderer.html, if the browser width is arranged to show the image elements all in one horizontal line, performing keyboard navigation in the vertical direction will result in an exception.... this exception is "benign" in that there is no visible alteration to the component behaviour, but is a hazard for further development as well as untidy.
