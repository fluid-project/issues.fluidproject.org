Currently Invitation style in is being over ridden by null if using Rich Text Inline Edit. This means that Invitation styles are not being applied by default regardless of how the user has defined their styles.

Apparently invitation styles was causing flickering when combined with tooltip and therefore invitation is set to null in the API to avoid this. This is an issue since a user should be able to style an invitation for the Rich Text Inline Edit.
