For testing the video player, we should make sure we have some real content to work with. Since we're going to put the player up on the ILDH, it makes sense for that content to be relevant to Inclusive Learning.

We should find some suitable videos and create captions and audio descriptions for them.

Some initial suggestions:

* the recent interview with Colin
* any interviews with Jutta
* any other video content we might have on the IDRC site
