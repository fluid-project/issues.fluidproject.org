The Fluid Project stylesheet is currently overriding Foundation styles. Instead the styles should be using mix-ins to create customizations. This will create a smaller stylesheet delivered to the client.

Also mixins will allow removal of hard-coded Foundation values (such as min-width: 40.063em for medium screen queries).
