Specification page should be created in the design space on the wiki. The spec should be the central place for developers to go to find information on developing the component.  Link to storyboards, storycards, functional requirements (if appropriate), and other existing documentation which would be useful in the spec rather than recreating. Interesting moments tables or accessibility information could also be included.
