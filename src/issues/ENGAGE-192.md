CouchDB does support paging\
\-------------------------------------------

Here is the info on couch.\
<http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/How_to_page_through_results>

Here are some notes from a discussion with Colin.\

New URLs

<http://server/engage/artifacts/browse.html?db=mmi&q=merchandising&from=1&to=25>

<http://server/engage/artifacts/artifact.html?db=mmi&id=12345.6&q=merchandising&from=1&to=25>

The browse component and view component need a friend. Some object or function that knows about paging

Need a way to keep page from reloading when URL changed for the change of the artifact (possibly with the use of a #).&#x20;

PagedDataSource

{\
total: 12000,\
current: 12,\
start: 1\
end: 25\
list: \[possibly the data or some subset such as the ids]\
}

on the next set it will be start: 26, end: 50

Resource based URL would look like this:\
<http://server/engage/mmi/artifacts/12345.6.html>\
<http://server/engage/mmi/artifacts/12345.6.json>\
<http://server/engage/mmi/artifacts.html?q=>"merchandising"\&from=12\&to=28
