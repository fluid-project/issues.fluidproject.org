You are able to tab to the jQuery tabs; however, once a tab has focus, you are unable to tab off. You are able to shift-tab away from them.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) open the jQuery UI tabs - keyboard accessibility page off of the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/keyboard-a11y/jquery-ui-tabs/jquery-ui-accessible-tabs.html>

2\) tap the 'tab' key until one of the jQuery tabs has focus.&#x20;

3\) tap the 'tab' key again. Notice that there is no response.

4\) tap 'shift-tab' to move away from the jQuery tabs.&#x20;
