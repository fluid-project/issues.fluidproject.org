the primary menu (in green) becomes blue when hovered over. The secondary menu (in blue with Workshops, Resources, etc.) does not have a hover state. I suggest a third colour choice for both hover states (or void of colour: white of screen) so the hover state doesn't visually connect to the menu above or below. For example: see attachment showing how the primary menu hover state blends with secondary menu colour
