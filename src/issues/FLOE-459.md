The dashboard should allow the user to:

* track the adjustment of their preferences
* reflect on the adjustment of their preferences with an assortment of open and closed questions (per the design)
* if the user says "Yes", they receive the prompts to reflect (checkboxes + free text question)
* if the user says "No", they do not receive the prompts to reflect
* longer term, a user can opt-in to tracking various things (typing speed, navigation, etc) from a preference change

For the initial prototype we'll demonstrate this by:

* implementing UIO on the Dashboard
* tracking changes made to preferences in UIO and generating appropriate journal entries from them

We should also track the source of a preference change such as:

* direct user interaction
* resets
