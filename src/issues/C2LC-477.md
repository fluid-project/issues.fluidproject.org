Environment: Windows 10, Firefox, NVDA

 

Steps to reproduce:

* Run NVDA

- Focus the Keyboard Settings button
- Press Enter to open the Keyboard Settings

 

Expected:

* The contents of the modal to be read (see the Delete All modal and the World Selector modal)

 

Actual:

* Nothing is read
* Additionally when I navigate using the up and down arrow keys all I hear is “blank”
