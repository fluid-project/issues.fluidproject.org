Following README.txt to set up DocPad locally, after running all steps in "Build with DocPad" section, accessing <http://localhost:9778/> in a browser gives "Server not found" error.

The output at running the second last step "docpad run --env static" shows this message:

"DocPad listening to <http://0.0.0.0:9778/>"

The DocPad seems listening to the host 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost. Accessing <http://0.0.0.0:9778/> throws "Unable to connect" error.

Note: The work for doc-base repo at this moment is still in progress as a Jonathan's personal repo: <https://github.com/jhung/doc-base/>&#x20;
