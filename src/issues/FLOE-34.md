To reproduce:\
1\) Use UIO to set some blatantly obvious settings, such as yellow-on-black, large font, comic sans\
2\) Use the Browse All to get to a resource summary page, and click the "View resource" page

Note that none of the UIO settings are applied to the resource page. The UIO button itself is not even present.
