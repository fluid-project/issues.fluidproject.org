The current latest version of WordPress (3.5.1) has a different dialog for uploading media. Our plugin does not work with this new version (in fact, it breaks the entire dialog).

We need to update the plugin to work properly with the latest WordPress, based on the new API, etc. Hopefully, this won't affect any of our form rendering, just the PHP part that adds the tab to the dialog, etc.
