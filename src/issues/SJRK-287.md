Reported by David at the Cities Co-design Session: users were unable to save a story with a GIF image in it.

This may be a symptom of the issue identified in SJRK-285, and so it may not be a problem. If this isn't possible to reproduce, it is likely that the server simply refused to publish stories with payloads greater than 1 MB (which many GIF files exceed)
