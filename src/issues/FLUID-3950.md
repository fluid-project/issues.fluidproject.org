The doctype on the demos is XHTML 1.0 Strict and doesn't validate for two main reasons:

-there is no attribute "src" &  element "iframe" undefined  for \<iframe src="about:blank">\</iframe>\
-end tag for "ul" which is not finished \<ul id="tabs" class="fl-tabs fl-tabs-left">\</ul> â€“ doesn't like that there are no children \<li>s

We should switch to transitional.
