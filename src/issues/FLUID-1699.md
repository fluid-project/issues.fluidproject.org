There's been an interesting discussion on the jQuery-a11y mailing list about the different styles of keyboard interaction for Tabs. We should modify our jQuery UI Tabs demo to illustrate these styles.

I'll see if I can summarize the two  \
potential options:

1\. As per the style guide, a tab should be selected immediately upon  \
being focused with the arrow key.\
2\. Tabs should not be automatically selected when they get focus. The  \
user should be able to explore the list of tabs with the arrow keys,  \
and then press Enter or Space to select their desired tab.

There are a few factors to consider when choosing one or the other. If  \
you check out tabs on your desktop OS, you'll find that they behave  \
differently between the Mac and Windows. Windows uses style #1, while  \
the Mac more or less uses style #2.

The other issue that you mention is AJAX. If the contents of a tab are  \
loaded dynamically upon selection, it could be quite tedious for the  \
user if they have to wait for each tab to load as they cycle through  \
the list.
