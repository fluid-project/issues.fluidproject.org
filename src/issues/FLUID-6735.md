As I remarked in the channel, the problem is caused by the \"misaligned\" material in the parent grade which can't avoid trying to resolve a reference into its model from its options as it constructs, which is not permitted in Infusion. If/when Infusion 6 is written, this class of problem will be removed by removing the distinction between \"models\" and \"general options\" but until then I'm not sure we can do much better about issuing a helpful diagnostic although I can try. Hopefully this reworking is good enough to let you make progress on your panelIndex issue\n\nFrom jobara:\n\n[@amb26](https://github.com/amb26) I was able to get past this issue in UIO+ by passing in a grade that contained the model configuration. Similar to what you described except I used the gradeNames directly.\n"

This was first discovered while trying to distribute the panelIndex to the local model path in UIO+ which uses a fullNOPreview prefs editor loader but displayed similar to the separated panel prefs editor. This occurred as the UIO was configured with a call to fluid.uiOptions and the options set on the prefsEditor option which is distributed down to the prefsEditor component.

The result is a circular reference error like: "Error in component configuration - a circular reference was found during evaluation of path segment "model of path ,model,panelIndex".

Some work arounds include supplying this configuration as part of a gradeName that is merged on top. Or distributing a record containing the specific configuration to the component's model.
