Confirm that this is the case!

It is possible, using the current method for restricting file uploads for video blocks to this MIME type

```java
accept="video/*"
```

that MP4 files are excluded from being uploaded using Safari in iOS or macOS. This may be solved by using

```java
accept="video/*,video/mp4"
```
