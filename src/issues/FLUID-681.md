When uploading a file, the progress bar on the first upload functions properly. Each subsequent upload gets increasingly innacurate.

Upload 1: Total Progress goes to 100%\
Upload 2: Total Progress goes to 50%\
Upload 3: Total Progress goes to 33%

...

Upload batch contained the same set of 7 files each time.
