Notes: May effect other browsers but I only tested the bug on the browsers listed under Environment

1\. In the Image Reorderer, click an image in the center of the image and drag the image two images to the right of it's start position\
2\. Drag the mouse until the drop target displays on the right side of the target image and then move the image back to the left until the drop target switches back to the left side.\
3\. Drop\
4\. The image will drop on the RIGHT side of the image.
