In [the discussion on an earlier pull](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/pull/140#discussion_r605886886), we discussed refactoring the scene dimension constructor to accept a minimum column (minX) and row (minY):

 

In the new coordinate system, the SceneDimensions constructor should really now be:

 

> constructor(minX: number, maxX: number, minY: number, maxY: number)

This impacts the panning logic as described here:

> We'd want a calculation like:

> `const panningLevel = ((characterState.xPos - minX) / (maxX - minX)) * 2 - 1;`
>
> Where `minX` and `maxX` are from the `SceneDimensions`. Unfortunately, right now `SceneDimensions` will not give us the right min X and max X. It may be too risky to rework `SceneDimensions` at this point in the 0.7 timeline. I have another thought on panning, which I will leave as a separate comment.

 

There are also implications for the scene panning, headers, et cetera.
