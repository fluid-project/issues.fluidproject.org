In this demo @ <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/progress/demo.html>

According to the WebAIM contrast checker (<http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/>), the current contrast ratio of the text between foreground colour (FFFFFF) and background color (5678C5) on the progress text (the text label that says e.g. "39%") is not sufficient.&#x20;

Maybe just change the background color in the progress-pop-up class to fix this.&#x20;
