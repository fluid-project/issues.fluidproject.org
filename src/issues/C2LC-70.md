Ability to record an image/video of your environment, tag different objects, and assign a simple if/then statement to them to build personal communication commands&#x20;

 

Details from co-design Sepideh's sketch: What if they could program their communication with their caregivers/instructors/parents? What if they could use robots to talk to the world around them? Give commands, ask for different things. How is this different than regular communication boards?

 

Possible options: 1. Paper prototypes 2. Video mockups 3. Low-fi dev experiments
