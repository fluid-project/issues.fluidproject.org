Searching thru the infusion master branch, the use of "autoInit" appears at a few places. According to the migration document - <http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/APIChangesFrom1_5To2_0.html>, "autoInit" is now the default for every component, so it should be removed from those places.
