Locked portlet message persists after attempting keyboard move above a locked portlet

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Use the keyboard to attempt to move a portlet above a locked portlet.

Notice that the warning message persists

Also happens in the springboard example
