In general, the Learner Options button is at the right of the main content area and the user menu is just inside that. In the Preview page of the Authoring tool, the user menu is always at the far right of the viewport, and the Learner Options button is somewhere inside that (but moving with window resize). The positioning of these two items in Preview mode should be fixed to maintain the basic conventions.
