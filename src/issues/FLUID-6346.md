Our current implementation looks like this - 

```java
fluid.isArrayable = function (totest) {
        return totest && (totest.jquery || Object.prototype.toString.call(totest) === "[object Array]");
    };
```

which is extremely generous and will catch any object with a property named "jquery". We finally fell foul of this when passing our own package.json file through fluid.copy in a Kettle test and it ended up truncating the entire "devDependencies" block which now includes an entry for jQuery (for some reason).

We should tighten up this test so it cannot be tripped by any plain object.
