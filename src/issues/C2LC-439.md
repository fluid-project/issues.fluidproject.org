When the keyboard input modal is open, it traps focus so that tabbing forward eventually wraps around to the first element in the modal.  The same is not true when using shift+tab.  When you reach the first focusable element and hit shift+tab, your focus goes somewhere that isn't visible.  No matter how many times you hit shift+tab, the focus never moves to the last focusable element.  Interestingly, even if you hit shift+tab multiple times, you only have to hit tab once to get back to the first focusable element.
