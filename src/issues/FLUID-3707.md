However, he was saying to be careful we should use it, with application coming before grid.

However, this change won't fix the current reorderers (including gridReorderer, layoutReorderer, ImageReorderer, listReorderer) because they already have their own roles set.  Alternatively, we can overwrite these roles by moving this line to the end of the block, which is at line 500, but this will make the reorderer to lose its original role (ie. from \"grid>>gridcell\" to \"application>>gridcell\", grid is lost).\\\nTo address this, Justin suggested to add another markup on top of the existing ones which will then allow us to include the application role (ie. \"application>>grid>>gridcell\") .  This might result a change in the API and might not be ideal for users because they will have a unwanted second-container on top.  Furthermore, styles and existing markup/layout might be affected. &#x20;\n"

The reorderer component should add the role of application. In some cases of the reorderer, there is already a role attached, the application role should wrap around  this.
