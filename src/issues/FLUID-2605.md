The current syntax for removeListener is eventFirer.removeListener(listener) - however, this is not fully integrated with the concept of a "listener namespace" - it should be possible to remove a listener knowing only its namespace. This could be done either by extending the argument list to eventFirer.removeListener(listener, namespace) or overloading on the type of the first argument.
