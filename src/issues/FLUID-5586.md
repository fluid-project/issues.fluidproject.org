Our records, acceptable currently as invokers and listener records, which hold the fields "changePath" and "value" to declaratively encode changes, are incompletely implemented.

i) They don't support the "type" field for changes which means that changes of type DELETE can't be encoded\
ii) They don't support a "changePath" of "" (or other falsy values such as 0) which implies that changes at model root can't be encoded
