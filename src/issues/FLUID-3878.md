Missing error messages for SWF and HTML5 uploaders when selected files exceed fileQueueLimit. &#x20;

Symptom:

In the SWF uploader, if the selected files exceed the file queue limit, no error message is given to the user.  Instead, nothing happens.  No file is added to the queue.  In the HTML5 uploader, files that don't exceed the file queue limit are added to the queue.  Any additional files are left out.  The SWF uploader never allows the fileQueueLimit to exceed fileUploadLimit, so a fileUploadLimit error should never happen. &#x20;

Suggestion:

Render a message indicating what the file queue limit is, as well as, the file upload limit.   We shouldn't be keeping these errors silent from the user.
