There are some incorrect uses of the Framework in the Video Player that we should address, including (but not necessarily limited to):

* no need to create a ChangeApplier (line 326 of VideoPlayer.js) - one already exists
* methods should be added to the component object in a postInit function instead of preInit, as described here: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Component+Lifecycle+and+autoInit>
