\<meta> tags currently in the html documents do not follow the recommendation by the IDPF for XHTML content:\
<http://www.idpf.org/accessibility/guidelines/content/meta/schema.org.php>

Also the contents of the meta tags are showing up rendered in the reader which may be related to improper encoding of metadata.
