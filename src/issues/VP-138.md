In Firefox 3.5, the time scrubber for the Video Player remains disabled until after the whole video has been downloaded from the server, even if the video is available for playback sooner.

This is due to the fact that we bind to the "loaded" event instead of the "durationchange" event, which tells us when the duration of the video is first known--much sooner than load time.
