In the view testing tasks the description of the title is:\
Title should appear, centered at the top, taking up exactly one line. If the title would otherwise extend past one line, the excess should be truncated and replaced with an ellipsis (i.e., "...").&#x20;

However the title for the MMI artifact extends over three lines (out of the title bar - when the Iphone is held vertically) and does not get truncated, etc.
