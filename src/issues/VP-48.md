Video Player will throw errors in Internet Explorer under any of the following conditions:

1\. Injecting a \<video> tag into the document when one hasn't been specified by the user\
2\. Injecting any child into an existing \<video> tag, such as when we inject a YouTube \<object> tag

This appears to be caused by the fact that IE will freak when manipulating any tag it has never heard of. As a result, we'll have to write some code to work around the issue by actively removing \<video> tags from the markup in IE before proceeding with the graceful degradation approach.
