Currently the Wordpress registration form only requires a username and email to register for the website.

The registration form should be expanded so that businesses can register for BI.

The following fields are likely required (to be confirmed):

* Business name (shown publicly in Feedback form)
* Contact person (private)
* Address (shown publicly in Feedback form)
* City (shown publicly in Feedback form)
* Telephone (private)
* Email (private)

This task may involve:

* Handle in both processing, validation
* Create an Admin interface to handle displaying of these new users
* New registered users need to be made into Feedback Subscribers (can be done in /wp-admin/options-general.php)

See: <https://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Registration_Form>,
