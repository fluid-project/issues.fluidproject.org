The "currency converter" sample at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Evented+Components> could be written with one less coded invoker if it were possible to specify IoC-resolved arrays of path segments as parts of "changePath" records - for example, we could have written the invoker definition for "updateRate" as

```java
updateRate: {
    changePath: ["rates", "{arguments}.0"],
    value: "{arguments}.1"
    }
```

this would be rather easy to implement and quite helpful. Currently changePath must be a string which is interpreted by fluid.parseValidModelReference.

We should take the opportunity to support some kind of top-level option such as "targetModel" so that we can easily express references to foreign components without some kind of painful ambiguity in the interpretation of the first path segment.
