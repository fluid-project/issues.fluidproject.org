If Fluid.js is in strict mode ("use strict"ðŸ˜‰ the DataBinding tests fail on the "ApplyHolderChangeRequest - cautious application + invalidation" tests for the "Add array at empty root" test.&#x20;

The issue appears to be caused by root being set to "ADD" in fluid.model.accessImpl. This falls through to the else condition which attempts to assign a value with array notation. In strict mode these are read only, but it seems like an error either way to be assigning values to "ADD" like this.
