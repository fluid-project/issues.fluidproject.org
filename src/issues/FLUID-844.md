At the moment, InlineEdit requires the edit field to be wrapped in a container element. This is sensible for cases where you've got a composite edit mode: for example, a text field with save and cancel buttons.

However, for simple cases where you only need a single edit field, there's no reason to require a container element.

Here's a workaround for this:

Change to InlineEdit.bindToDom():\
var isEditSameAsContainer = instance.editContainer.is(instance.selectors.edit);\
var containerConstraint =  isEditSameAsContainer ? instance.container : instance.editContainer;\
instance.editField =  $(instance.selectors.edit, containerConstraint);

The user would have to override the default selectors for edit and editContainer and set them to the same value.

We should probably come up with a more general approach to handling this. Maybe in the DOM Binder?
