The `fluid.loadTestingSupport()` function needs to be called by users of jqUnit when using it within Infusion's node.js profile. This loads qunit, jqunit and the IoC Testing framework within the special V8 context holding Infusion itself. However, the action of this function is not idempotent and can lead to horrifying and incomprehensible disasters if it manages to load a duplicate QUnit object - QUnit has an immature approach to multiple inclusion and simply writes `window.QUnit = QUnit`.

The symptoms appeared when trying to debug test loading issues in <https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17/files> .

When adding a self-contained fluid.loadTestingSupport call in an individual test file, we received incomprehensible failures which (with a lot of extra debug tracing) resemble this:

One of the QUnits believes it is in the middle of a test, and the other one doesn't
