I used column shifting to make this somewhat more consistent, but we may want to consider this further.\n\n \n"

The floeproject.org site can be converted to responsive behaviour in advance of actually integrating mobile UIO with it.

Depending on complexity this may involve using Foundation's responsive grid, or possibly Gridlex: <http://gridlex.devlint.fr/> - will update with more information after the work is further along.
