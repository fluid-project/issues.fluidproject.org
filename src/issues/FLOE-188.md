Find out if there any tools that help determine the accessibility of EPUB books. The results of this research will become resources which we will include in the Inclusive EPUB Guide.

Work should be documented under this wiki page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Inclusive+EPUB>
