Hitting enter at this point activates the new tab.

When tabbing through the set of reorderable jQuery tabs, the focus styling does not display.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) open the reorderable jQuery page from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/jquery-tabs/jquery-tabs.html>

2\) tap the 'tab' key until one of the reorderable jQuery tabs has focus.

3\) tap the 'tab' key again. Notice that the focus styling is not present on any tab.

4\) press 'enter', one of the other tabs should have been selected.
