Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Connect to Dash
* Press Connect to Dash when it’s connected 
* Press esc or click outside of the bluetooth connect modal or cancel button

The Bluetooth connection to Dash is connected, but the status mark changes to a circle (not connected) and the run button becomes disabled

Notes:

This is caused by state change of dashConnectionStatus when we close the bluetooth connection window. When the window is closed, we are setting dashConnectionStatus to ‘notConnected’ but the bluetooth connection is still connected.
