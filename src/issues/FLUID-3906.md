You're supposed to be able to click anywhere inside an inlineEdit field to switch to edit mode, but for the rich-text editor, this doesn't work - you **must** click right on the "Edit" link.

To reproduce:\
1\) Open the rich text demo:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/html/inlineEdit.html>\
2\) Click somewhere in the text box (but not on the "Edit" link)

The component should switch into edit mode, but doesn't.
