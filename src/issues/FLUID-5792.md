I would like to create a new repository called "**ci-service**" that would hold configuration data related to our continuous integration service (based on Jenkins).

I don't have access to the Fluid Project organization in GitHub so I will need some help to create this repository, set appropriate permissions and WebHook configuration.

**GitHub users that need write access to the repository:** avtar, waharnum, gtirloni

Please also create a WebHook based on the "GitHub Plugin (Jenkins) with the following URL: <https://ci-int.fluidproject.org/github-webhook>

Alternatively, if these users could be made admins then any of them could carry out the configuration (or future changes) as required.
