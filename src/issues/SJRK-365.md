What's working now:

* Tabbing from delete button to the first block - focus lands on the block group (then moves to enabled up/down reorder buttons, then to delete checkbox, then to first block field).

Bug 1:

* Tabbing out of any block lands focus on the first block field of the next block (i.e. Block heading)

Behaviour we want:

* Tabbing out of any block lands focus on the next block group (then to reorder buttons, etc.)
* Focusing on the block as a group enables:
  * moving blocks with keyboard shortcuts (shift-Control + arrow keys on Mac, Ctrl + arrow keys on windows) as well as
  * moving focus from block to block with keyboard arrow keys

Bug 2:

* Shift-tab does not allow focus on a block group

Behaviour we want:

* Shift-tab order to be the reverse of tab order (such that Shift-tabbing from a block moves focus to last field of block above, then through the block fields, delete checkbox, re-order buttons, and finally to the block group, then out of the block)

Note: this is potentially an issue with the Infusion Reorderer component and not the Story Tool itself
