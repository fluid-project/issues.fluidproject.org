If an amara-based transcript file is not loaded as part of the video player initialization process, then it won't be highlighted as the video plays. I suspect it's because the code to hook up the highlighting is being executed before the call to amara is returning.

To reproduce:\
1\) Open the video player demo page and use UIO to set the default language choice to French.\
2\) Reload the page.\
3\) Select English transcripts.\
4\) Play the video.

The transcripts will not highlight.
