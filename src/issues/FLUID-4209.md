It seems like jQuery is aware of this issue and there is no obvious fix: <http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7117>\\\n\"It appears that only \\<a> elements generated programmatically using strings exhibit this problem. Elements that are generated like $('\\<a>', { href: '#foo' }) work properly, as do elements that existed in the document when it was loaded.\n\nShort of scanning all strings passed to jQuery and html for anchors and manually resetting their attributes, there is almost certainly no way that jQuery can work around this issue, as IE is irreparably modifying the href property when building elements from strings. You can see this by inspecting the generated markup (the href attribute magically becomes absolute). As a result, this is probably only going to be a documentation fix. \"\n"

      "body": "The use of .hash doesn't fix the \"root of the problem\" since the href is still appeared to be a full URL on IE7.  I have ran a few more **quick** tests to nail down the problem, as follow (will put them into unit test format if required):\n\nTo reproduce, run the following on IE7: \\\n\\<div class=\".container\">\\</div>\\\n$('.container').html('\\<a class=\"link2\" href=\"#foo\">Test Link2\\</a>')\\\nconsole.log($('.link2').attr('href'));  //expected \"#foo\", actual \"<http://domain/#foo>\"\n\nIt seems like crafting \\<a href> with .html() will cause IE7 to print out the entire URL, (IE8, 9, Chrome, FF are fine).\n\nThe next question is what is generating the \"\\<a href>\"?  The answer is the renderer.  I looked into the framework/renderer/js/fluidRenderer.js and saw the following:\\\nline 1491\\~1496:\\\n1491        if ($.browser.msie) {\\\n1492            $(node).html(rendered);\\\n1493        }\\\n1494        else {\\\n1495            node.innerHTML = rendered;\\\n1496        }\n\nIf we are running IE7, we will execute line 1492 and the problem I mentioned above will occur.  I tried replacing line 1492 with line 1495, the href is still generated with a full URL.  This could be something that is on the IE7 parser which jQuery cannot fix (<http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7117>).\n"
