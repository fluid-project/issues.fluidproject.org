We have lots of little objects in Infusion that aren't full-fledged components, but do participate in options merging. Antranig wrote a function in Kettle called fluid.littleComponent() that sets one of these up. Let's move it into the Infusion framework so it's available for components regardless of whether they're running on the client or the server.
