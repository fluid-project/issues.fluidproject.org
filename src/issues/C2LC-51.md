A collection of objects, characters, scenes, sounds, movements, interactions, qualities (color, texture, scale, volume, pitch, etc.) . Students can build anything they desire and add these elements to it. They can build a bizarre creature, a story or a game. Teachers or parents can define specific objectives or learning goals.&#x20;

* sounds, movements, interactions, and qualities can be added to an object&#x20;
* students can share their assets or their full creatures/stories with others and use theirs as well&#x20;

Details from co-design (Jon):

Story maker:  Have objects be able to say or do things at key time, or in response to input or event. This story maker can be used to make different kinds of narratives Idea: Bizarre Creature: Have a robot that you can control with your muscles, brain activity, etc. Imagine being able to control something using “The Force”.

 

We might want to try some low-fi development experiments.We tried a very simple version of this at Beverley school using Powerpoint
