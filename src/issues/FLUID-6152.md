The Fluid community has recently adopted the Contributor Covenant code of conduct, and we have created a new [Inclusion](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusion+in+the+Fluid+Community) page in the wiki.

We should add a prominent link to this page in our README so that people who find us on Github are aware of our inclusion policy.
