Currently we require a CLA for individuals and a CCLA for organizations that contribute to our projects. ( see: <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Licensing> ). Our current process requires a contributor to submit one or more of the forms as a signed document, either in person or faxed. This is cumbersome both to the contributor and for us to collect. It is also a barrier for contribution. We should look into either an improved process (e.g. automated) or remove our requirement for CLAs altogether.&#x20;

* Action: Team of 2 to investigate CLA assistant or some other more lightweight option
* Consider some kind of UI which operates within github whenever a pull request is opened, indicating that the contributor agrees to the repo-wide licence
* Simon and Colin have indicated interest
* Survey other inclusive communities that we respect (e.g. hood.ie)
* None of this work looks like a huge priority compared to other immediate projects - it will be done "in the corners"
