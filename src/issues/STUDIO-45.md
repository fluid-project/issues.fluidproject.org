We have done a first pass at displaying the studios on a mobile. Here are some of the things we need to do to improve the experience:

* When viewing in portrait orientation\
  &#x20;    1\. the back button should be in the top nav bar \
  &#x20;    2\. there should be more space between entries\
  &#x20;    3\. there should be more space below the login button\
  &#x20;    4\. the edges of the image should line up with the text on the index pages

- When viewing in landscape orientation\
  &#x20;    1\. the footer should be lined up with the content&#x20;
