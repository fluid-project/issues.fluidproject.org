At the moment, the Screen Navigator component provides a means for navigating between documents displayed on a phone. In order to provide seamless transitions between pages, we update the DOM via ajax instead of reloading the page. As a result, we break bookmarkability and history support.

Most AJAX apps have settled on a solution that uses URL fragments to support bookmarkability. While this isn't ideal, it should work quite nicely with a bit of help from the server-side.
