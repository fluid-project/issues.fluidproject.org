I was able to publish a story with media blocks without their URLs being translated. When the story was viewed, the media files were missing.

I've not been able to reproduce this issue.

At the time I was running:

* <https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/tree/b22a0b39ae517abee8c184f73c7ad92218e60f48>
* with `package.json` modified to use <https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/tree/SJRK-190>

I captured the published story from CouchDB and have attached it.
