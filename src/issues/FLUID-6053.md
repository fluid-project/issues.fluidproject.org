Steps to reproduce:

1\. Open the UI Options demo\
2\. Open the Preferences Editor\
3\. Under "emphasis" select "Enlarge buttons, menus, text-field, and other inputs"\
4\. Close and re-open the Preferences Editor so that the changes are applied to it

Notice that the layout for "text size" and "line space" are both off, as the textfield wraps to a new line.
