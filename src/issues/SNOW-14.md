Wordpress at the moment does not seem to globally support compiling stylus files into css; see this Stack Overflow issue where the user tried to do so with a theme other than twentytwelve: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15592825/how-to-make-wordpress-style-css-work-as-a-stylus-styl-file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15592825/how-to-make-wordpress-style-css-work-as-a-stylus-styl-file\))

We would need to either:

1. Create a grunt task with the caveat that we'd need to create tests and would be very time consuming;
2. Understand how Wordpress works; there are plugins that process stylus files – see <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-stylus-processor/> which would be a good example to learn from if this is doable without using a plugin.
