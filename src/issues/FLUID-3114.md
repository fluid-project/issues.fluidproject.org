      "body": "The error is occurring in SWFUpload's code: setButtonDisabled(). We invoke this method inside our SWFUploadSetupDecorator, which is responsible for setting up a Flash 10-specific configuration of SWFUpload. This code is responsible for disabling the Flash-based \"Browse Files\" button, using a public API provided by SWFUpload.\n\nThis has become a pretty familiar scenario with SWFUpload: whenever a browser of Flash upgrade comes along, SWFUpload breaks. In this case, their setButtonDisabled() method is exploding. I haven't had a chance to fully triage the problem, but there is a temporary workaround:\n\nIf you're okay with the fact that users will be able to open the file dialog while an upload is in progress, removing lines 118 and 121 of SWFUploadManager.js--or better yet, wrapping those lines in a try/catch will squelch the error. This is quite a hack, and we'll make sure we find a reasonable fix that doesn't involve patching code directly.\n"
