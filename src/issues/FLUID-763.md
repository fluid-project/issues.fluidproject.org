Through a series of emails, the following 3 Primary audiences are going to be targeted (listed in priority):

1\. lurker (someone new who wishes to learn more about the project)\
2\. contributor (someone who wants to help with the project)\
3\. implementor (someone who wants to use Fluid in their own software)

The navigation will be restructured to meet the needs of the above 3 parties. The following is the proposal:

Fluid Components

* downloads and demos (FLUID-764)
* source code (links to SVN, and different bundles FLUID-765)
* designs (design patterns, designs for current and upcoming components FLUID-767)
* user manual (how to install, run, test, integrate Fluid components FLUID-754)

Knowledge Base (this category seems a bit ambiguous now â€“ see question above)

* user experience (other wiki pages related to design and UX)
* development (other wiki pages related to development)

Community

* meetings (FLUID-770)
* current work (will include link to planned future work)
* how to contribute (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-771#icft=FLUID-771>)
* disciplines (may be moved into Knowledge Base - UX/Design section)
* discussions (points to Mailing lists, Breeze, IRC, IM, also Meetings) FLUID-772&#x20;
* Contributor directory (hopefully some content to be automatically\
  pulled from Wiki profile pages)

About Fluid

* aims and goals
* contact us
