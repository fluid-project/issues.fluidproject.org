The algorithm applied by jqUnit.assertDeepEq (ultimately punching through to QUnit.propEqual) will consider all primitive values as equivalent, which is incredibly unhelpful. This caused significant problems with <https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/59> where this utility was mistakenly used to consider that `true` was equal to `false`. We need to adjust this implementation to give sensible results in these cases.
