The Uploader's internal architecture currently relies on a bundle of largely stateless functions that require a lot of arguments to be passed into it. This approach is very error-prone, because it doesn't group functionality and required state together in a coherent manner. We need a clearer architectural strategy for breaking Uploader into several units of behaviour that are composed together to form the larger component. This will make the code simpler to work in, more maintainable, and more flexible for consumers.
