      "body": "Skype chat 2020-10-06:\n\nHey everyone, Daniel and Michelle and I are tasking out work for 0.5 and we had a question regarding the logic for bumping up against the edge of the scene. Prior to 0.5, our plan has been to snap back to the centre of the appropriate grid cell when the character moved back onto the scene. I'm wondering if that still makes sense for 0.5 where movement will no longer be constrained to centre of cell to centre of cell. In that case, would we prefer to then treat the edge as a barrier? I know we have talked about different interpretation for the edge: is it an edge that the character stops at or is it an indication that the character is out of the scene? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.\\\nNow that I think about it, I think there are 3 possible semantics:\\\n1\\) the edge is a barrier that the character stops at\\\n2\\) the character moves off scene but a single movement brings them back on, no matter how far they try to move off scene\\\n3\\) the character moves off scene and we continue to track their position, then if we were to 'zoom out', we would see the movement that they have made while off scene\\\nor pan\n"

Characters can only move as far as the outermost grid line. They will stop with their center on the grid line. They can still be moved along the outermost grid line. Any movements that would take them off screen will have no effect.
