The Workshops / Collaborations / Consultations page should be updated to look nicer. Right now it doesn't do very much except list documents:

<https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Workshop%2C+Consultations%2C+and+Integrations>

Also the individual collaborations should be updated:

* Pressbooks
* Rebus
* Hypothes.is (design crit, community meeting and email thread)
* Macmillan Learning - sim crits and feedback
* Edify - UIO and Table of Contents
* Bodies in Translation
* BIT / Vibra Fusion labs
