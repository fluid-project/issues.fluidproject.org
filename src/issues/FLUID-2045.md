Uploader Storycard 9 (Fluid - 2045):  Make status bar green while showing and progress and after completion

Details:

* Rather than the current gray, make the status bars green (on individual files and the global status at bottom).&#x20;
* Once upload is complete, the global status bar should stay green (see Uploader Storyboard - Simple Upload?)
