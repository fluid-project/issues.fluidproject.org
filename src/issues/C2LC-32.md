      "body": "Hi @@Daniel Cho, thanks for clarifying. Just so I fully understand (I think I'm familiar with this kind of issue but I might be misunderstanding), is it the case that you can't even start scanning for a bluetooth device until a user event (click, keypress, etc.) is fired?\n\nIf that's the case, we should have a \"Find Robots\" or something similar (@@Sepideh Shahi can decide) button that starts the process. But the best case situation, if it were possible, is that we'd start scanning as soon as the application is first loaded.\n"

      "body": "Thank you Colin,&#x20;\n\nUnfortunately, user gesture is a must, this is an information from the [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web): \"User Gesture Required\\\nAs a security feature, discovering Bluetooth devices with navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice must be triggered by a user gesture such as a touch or a mouse click. We're talking about listening to pointerup, click, and touchend events.\"\n\nOur current model has a button for user gesture, with name Connect to Dash and we can definitely change the name to more generic one like \"Find Robots\" in the future.\n"

      "body": "Great, thanks. Yes, this is a way of preventing personal \"fingerprinting\" (sites tracking you without cookies by doing things like figuring out what devices are near you) on the web platform.\n\n@@Sepideh Shahi may have some other ideas, but I think it's reasonable to have a button that starts the process. ideally, it wouldn't be completely modal (so that it doesn't interrupt the process of making a program) but it may be easier for users if we walk them through the process of finding and connecting to one or more robots.\n"

      "body": "Yeah that's a good idea, we definitely need to create some kind of tutorial for users to use our coding environment. The modal idea was only for the case where we need to ask users without gestures, but since we can't use the API without user gesture, we don't need a modal for this. Thank you for your comments!\n"

When there are robots available near by, inform users about robot presence and ask if they would like to connect to any of those.
