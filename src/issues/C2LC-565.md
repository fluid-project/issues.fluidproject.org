Currently, we have 2 modals with radio buttons and when the modals open up, we are setting focus on one of the radio button options. After focus is set on them, somehow NVDA shortcuts are not working, and there are two ways to make them work:

1. Press ESC before using the shortcuts
2. Tab to next navigable element first then use the shortcuts
