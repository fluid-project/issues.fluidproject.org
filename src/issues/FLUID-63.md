I think it's simply of matter of copying it over from the Dojo trunk. The Fluid version is at:\\\n<https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/utoronto/fluid/components/trunk/src/webapp/component-templates/js/dojo/>\n\nThe original dojo source along with the License file (called \"LICENSE\") is at\\\n<http://trac.dojotoolkit.org/browser/dojo/trunk>\"\n"
