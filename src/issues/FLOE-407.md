The implementation of the language panel uses setTimeout() to break the event firing of langButtonsReady out of the synchronous flow (<https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L833-L835>) to ensure the button div scrolling has completed when the event is fired. Otherwise, buttons.offset() used in listeners for this event returns position values before scrolling occurs.

Should investigate if setTimeout() can be removed.
