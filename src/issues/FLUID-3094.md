Reopening an FCK editor does not place the caret in the text area

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Inline Edit quick start example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/demo.html>

2\) Open one of the Rich Text inline editors that uses FCK editor

3\) make a change and save it.

4\) Reopen the same editor and notice that the caret is not in the text area
