This applies to Safari as well.\n\nThe reason the MochiKit tests fail is because they have not been factored out yet - they shouldn't be run.\n"

Previously, the Lightbox jsUnit tests did not run when using IE7, Safari on WIndows, nor Safari on Mac.  Michelle discovered a technique whereby one defines a "exposeTestFunctionNames()" function that publishes a string array containing the names of the test functions themselves. The function was added to TestConstants.js.

This technique has worked â€“ the tests now run when using IE7 and Safari.  To be clear, only the tests in GridHandlerLayoutTests.js and LightboxTests.js were published using the technique; that is, none of the tests in MochiLIghtboxTests.html were so published.  As such, all of the tests continue to run, and run successfully, in FF.

None of the GridLayoutTests fail in IE7 nor Safari.  Seven of the Lightbox tests fail in IE7, and one fails in Safari.  The MochiLIghtbox tests fail, but that appears to be due to the lack of published test function names.  An attempt to add an exposeTestFunctionNames() to the top of MochiLIghtboxTests.html caused one of them to fail in FF (previously, it passed when not published).  The code committed to svn does **not** publish the MochiLightbox test names so that all continue to pass in FF.

We need to determine:

* why certain tests fail in IE7,
* why certain tests fail in Safari,
* how to publish the MochiLightbox tests such that they are run in IE7 and Safari, but do not fail in FF.

Notably, the ones that fail in IE7 and Safari frequently have to do with testing focus.
