This replaces Fluid-522 which was a subtask of a design review.  Created a new implementation task and will recreate the subtasks and close the others (can't move a subtask).

In the uPortal 3 reorderable portlets mock-up, the indication of a locked portlet (currently a padlock icon) is not sufficient. We need to either implement the darkened portlet styling presented in the design mockups, or a popup message saying that the portlet cannot be moved.
