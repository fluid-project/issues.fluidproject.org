We had to make some changes to UIO in order to get it to change language and re-render along with other ui elements without reloading the page, but these features should probably be part of UIO in general. They are also perhaps not the best smelling code.

in **storyTelling-page.js**, the functionsÂ sjrk.storyTelling.page.reloadUioMessages,Â sjrk.storyTelling.page.sjrk.storyTelling.page.updateUioPanelLanguages and their associated (injected) listeners on the page's uio component, as well as the other configuration of said component.

in **UIOMultilingualDemo.js**, the entire file. This is based on Alan's work in this repository: <https://github.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual>
