Right now, it takes a bit of work to construct a Reorderer instance. You need to pass in a number of arguments that are essentially internal concerns to the Reorderer, such as itemFinders, the LayoutHandler, and so on. This probably presents a barrier to entry for most casual users who might just want to quickly reorder a list, grid or set of portlets, without getting into the complexities of our more advanced options and data structures.

Here's a suggested approach:

fluid.reorderList(containerSelector, itemSelector, orderChangedCallback);\
fluid.reorderGrid(containerSelector, itemSelector, orderChangedCallback);\
fluid.reorderPortlets(containerSelector, portletSelectors, options);
