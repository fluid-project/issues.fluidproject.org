I'm not sure that we really want to add to the document in this way, but certainly, knowing the advantages of using fluid would be important.\n\n2\\) I feel that the part at the end <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Flutter+without+Fluid> needs some elaboration if it is to be useful. The reader is encouraged to download code, but there is no code tour, only a summary comparison of the advantages of using fluid.\n\nMy recommendation is a separate document addressing these two issues which is linked to the original document in some way. The idea of WHY can be discussed more fully in a separate page.\n"
