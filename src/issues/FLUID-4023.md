This is causing problems for containers, specifically in IE.&#x20;

Research more...

Uportal:\
-removed and replaced with script from 'box model' on positioniseverything.net\
-used jquery helper styles "ui-helper-clearfix"\
-applied to all containers w/ overflow

TODOs and Requirements

1\.	Research possible solutions\
⁃	work cross browser (a-grade at least)\
⁃	force floats to clear, to be contained within their parent\
⁃	content should remain within the borders of its parent\
⁃	clearing should not force the parent to clear all the way down to the bottom of neighbouring float columns\
⁃	the fix should not cause unexpected scroll bars or hidden content\
2\.	Implement test page that allows you to compare the various solutions\
3\.	Update fl-fix and/or add an additional clearfix solution to the fss
