It seems the logic is that because it can't be used to sort versions, as build metadata give equal precedence, it is to be ignored and thus stripped out.\n\nSee:\n\n* <https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12825>\n* <https://github.com/npm/node-semver/pull/221>Â (pr to add build metadata to npm-semver, but as of yet has been ignored)\n"

Currently fluid-publish creates dev builds and appends the date and commit hash to the end. This is currently separated by a "." but should be separate by a "+" according to <http://semver.org/#spec-item-10>
