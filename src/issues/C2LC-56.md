A gird view - each tile on the grid has a specific condition. learner needs to fulfill conditions on each tile to proceed to the next tile&#x20;

 

Details from co-design:&#x20;

Each tile has different conditions to proceed. Conditioning may be: if you have passed tile A, you can go forward or you have to go left. This helps to enhance logical thinking

 

We could do low-fi design experiments like role play.
