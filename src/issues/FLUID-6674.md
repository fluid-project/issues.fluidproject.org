Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the [inline edit demo](https://build-infusion.fluidproject.org/demos/inlineedit/)
2. Add a large unbroken text to the inline edit field. Enter enough that when in view mode the screen is scrolled horizontally.Â 
3. Notice that the left side of the screen is clipped and cannot be scrolled into view.
