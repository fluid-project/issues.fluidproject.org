All links in the Infusion-Docs related to Model Transformation API should point at the Model Transformation API docs page, and not to the GPII Wiki.

From the [IRC Channel](https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-11-17/?msg=76615743\&page=1):

if u search thru infusion-docs repo with this link: <https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions>, there are a few pages having links pointing to it. those links should be repointed to <http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html>
