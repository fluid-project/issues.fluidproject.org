placing the image reorderer in a fixed width container can cause the avatar to be out of sync with the pointer

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Place the image reorderer inside a container with a fixed width (i.e. 1000px wide)

2\) Using the mouse, attempt to drag and drop an image from one of the lower rows.

Notice that the avatar is not under the pointer and that the drop targets don't appear where expected
