We don't bind to switch keys that the user wants to use for something else.\n2. We allow them to use the keys their switch sends to control things.\n\nIn other words, the keyboard shortcuts could be a means of allowing switches to interact with the coding environment.\n"

Shift + arrow is use for text selection in most circumstances.\n\nAs an alternative, perhaps we could use gaming layouts like AWSD, JKLI, or (like vi) HJKL.\n"

They suggest making the behaviour configurable (which is one of our longer term goals here).   I was thinking that our first pass might focus on using a modifier, specifically the alt key, which should have less conflicts with browser commands.\n\nAs an example, Chrome has a key binding for nearly every letter of the alphabet in combination with the command/control key, but has none that only use the alt key in combination with a single letter.\n"

For example, we need a keyboard shortcut to get to the last add node (end of the program). Ideally we would have some kind of UI to make the controls configurable, and likely we would need user instructions as well.

 

Feedback from the April 2021 co-design included:

* Up and down arrows to navigate on the user interface :question:
* Shortcuts for heading navigation (e.g. tabs) :question:
* Shortcuts for scene information :check\_mark:
* Shortcuts for refresh button (e.g. Alt-R) :check\_mark:
* Shortcuts for for play button :check\_mark:
* Shortcuts for adding blocks to the beginning or the end of the program
* Shortcut for adjusting speed of program executed/being played :check\_mark:

In addition, we know we need:

* A modal to display / configure the keyboard shortcuts.
* A toggle to turn off keyboard handling (on the modal).
* A toggle to open close the modal itself.
