As discussed in group chats, in working on C2LC-302 I am doing more markdown editing than we generally do.  I think it would be helpful to add rudimentary linting for markdown files.  My idea is to:

1. Use the library markdownlint we use in other projects via npx (so that it is not actually a new dependency).
2. Configure it to match our most commonly used style at the moment.
3. Fix any current linting errors.
4. Add  the markdown linting to the end of our CI builds.
