It seemed the test framework wasn't unbinding the first listener after it was called initally, and so when the language was changed it was reasserting that the onControlsBound event had fired, seemingly even after the components had been destroyed. I have commented out the test sequence item in question:\n\n```java\n\"event\": \"{pageTest page menu}.events.onControlsBound\",\r\n\"listener\": \"jqUnit.assert\",\r\n\"args\": \"menu onControlsBound event fired.\"\n```\n"

This is not ideal, and the cause should be determined and addressed.\n"

There are some tests which should be added for sjrk.storyTelling.page:

* ~~uiLanguage changing and associated events~~
  * ~~check its value when it's expected to have changed~~
* ~~onContextChangeRequested event~~
* ~~loading from and storing to cookieStore~~
* ~~storySpeaker listener~~
* ~~storySpeaker creation timing~~
* ~~test the functions directly~~
