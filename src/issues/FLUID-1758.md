No drop target for themed reorderable tabs

Steps to reproduce

1\) Open the Reorderer Springboard example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/Reorderer.html#>

2\) Using the mouse, drag and drop the tabs in example 4 or 5

Notice that no drop targets appear
