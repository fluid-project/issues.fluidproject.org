Currently, the Uploader sample files include jQuery JS files that are not required for the Uploader to work:

* The inline version (sample-code/uploader/inline/uploader.html) include ui.core.js
* The pop-up version (sample-code/uploader/pop-up/index.html) includes ui.draggable.js

These file references should be removed.
