<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/103> reintroduced some inline CSS styling that had previous been in use in the previous incarnation of our documentation on the Confluence wiki platform. Given we had had to manage without this for a while, the information that it conveyed (that particular sets of options were exclusive and not to be used simultaneously) had been encoded by other means (particular reference symbols such as daggers and double daggers). However, we should review the use of this styling and whether it is worth hoisting up into the shared infusion-docs.css area
