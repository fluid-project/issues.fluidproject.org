I've made a few attempts to improve the clarity of the section on injected components in src/documents/SubcomponentDeclaration.md, but it still isn't clear enough - see review comments on pull <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/104> . This JIRA is a placeholder for suggestions for improvement or related discussion.
