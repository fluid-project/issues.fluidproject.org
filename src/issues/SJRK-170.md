Here are a few more notes from that discussion:\n\nVideo content blocks don’t support captions, would it be possible to enable captions or host the videos through something like YouTube?\n\nThoughts on the issue:\n\n* Add a new kind of block which is a YouTube link? Or a new field\n* Would it be either/or?\n  * \"Upload video\" button or \"Link video\" button\n* Find markup to wrap video addresses based on what site they come from\n  * YouTube\n  * Vimeo\n  * Twitter?\n* Else check the URL for a video file extension and just render it as a video\n"
