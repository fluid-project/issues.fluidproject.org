The dynamic routes used in the menu only work when running through the webpack-dev-server.

After running&#x20;

```
npm run build
```

, the contents of the public folder do not have directories like /htp1, /level1, level2, etc (so they generate 404 errors when deployed to a production webserver).

It's as if the react-router-dom component is not working as expected for some reason. Tested with Chrome 83.

When it works:

```
npm install
npm run start
open http://localhost:8888
```

When it fails:

```
npm install
npm run build
python -m http.server --directory public
open http://localhost:8888 -> click menu options
```

It seems that Alan Harnum had some problems creating a deployable unit in INFRA-217 as well.

Additionally, the UglifyJsPlugin from webpack 3.10.0 causes a build error. It's necessary to remove it from webpack.production.config.js to get a clean build (which still has the issue with the routes).
