Replacing the content of an inline edit field with a space character removes the inline edit field.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the bSpace demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Replace the contents of one of the inline edit fields with a space character. Notice that the inline edit field and the spacing for it has been removed. You are able to click the undo button to bring the field back.
