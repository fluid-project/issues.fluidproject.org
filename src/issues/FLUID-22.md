Clicking on white space on a thumbnail or the thumbnail image causes the item to disappear from the Lightbox. Happens in IE6.

Clicking on the text link in the thumbnail activates the link.

It almost looks like the drag and drop action occurs very briefly before the item disappears when mouse is released (i.e. the image "pops" off the background like in a DnD action).  Therefore could be related to Fluid-5.
