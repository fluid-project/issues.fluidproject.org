Also, considering we've got a panel and enactor implemented as part of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6303#icft=FLUID-6303>, it follows that any value stored as a result of actions within that panel should be stored along with the values from other panels, i.e. on the \"preferences\" key.\n\nRevised goal:\n\n* get it to store and load properly from {prefsEditorLoader}.settings.preferences.locale\n* add any required tests\n* readjust the docs (this could/should be a separate Jira)\n"

It is definitely required to store language as a preference for the panel/enactor. However, when using the schema it won't be stored at \"preferences.locale\". The exact location is specified based on the type name. For example, it would end up being something like \"preferences.fluid\\_prefs\\_localization\".\n"

Per discussion on this pull request: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/139>

1\. "locale" is currently in the code as being set at "{prefsEditorLoader}.settings.preferences.locale"\
2\. It shouldn't be there.\
3\. We're going to move it back to "{prefsEditorLoader}.settings.locale", as the documentation specifies and update any tests or functions accordingly

This will store "locale" at the same level as "panelIndex" - a persisted property important for the component's state maintenance between reloads that is not a user-editable preference with a panel, enactors, etc.
