During our authoring call about FLUID-4884, Yura suggested that an important and confusing source of errors was caused by listeners registered with "zombie components" that have already been destroyed. After a component's onDestroy has fired, there should be a hard and immediate error triggered by any listener notifying it, in order to make debugging this kind of issue as clear and direct as possible
