The issue is that the uploader is created in two varieties of configuration, one where the progressiveChecker is attached to the component as \"uploaderContext\" and another where it is attached to the \"staticEnvironment\". All of these areas of the framework are in the process of being rethought, together with JIRAs such as <http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5249> and <http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5241> - so it would be best to rework this implementation thoroughly - at the same time renaming it as \"contextAwareness\" or so.\n"

Currently the progressiveCheckerForComponent looks up a components defaults when attempting to find the the progressiveCheckerOptions.&#x20;

<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/enhancement/js/ProgressiveEnhancement.js#L130>

However, this ignores any options supplied to component at instantiation time. Amongst other things, this prevents an integrator from directly adding a progressive enhancement step to a component at instantiation.
