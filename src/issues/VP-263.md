The applier events should be exposed through the components own event system so that it will be easier to extend functionality for both developers of Video Player and any integrators using it.&#x20;

Currently throughout the codebase there are a lot of instances where in block of code a listener is programmatically attached to one of the appliers model change event paths.&#x20;

e.g.

someFunc = function (that) {\
that.applier.modelChanged.addListener("path", function () {\
doSomething();\
});\
}

In doing this, the event is not exposed to any other function. Another addListener would have to be added for the next call that needs to be executed.&#x20;
