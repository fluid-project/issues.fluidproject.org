UIEnhancer unit test throws "invalid argument" error when a div that is detected thru container.parent() is passed into a jQuery function container.css("font-size").

\<div id="main" class="container fl-layout-linear fl-font-size-90 fl-font-sans">\
\</div>

This issue has been fixed by explicitly providing a parent div with a given "font-size" value. But this is still a potential issue.
