Autobinding not working for radio buttons when making a selection with the keyboard

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the renderer demo

2\) Click the render button to render out the data

3\) Using the keyboard  change the radio button selection

Notice that the data to the right isn't updated, but if you use the mouse to change the radio button the data is updated.

This means that for components that render out radio buttons (such as the Infusion Builder) changes made to the radio button selection with the keyboard will have no effect.
