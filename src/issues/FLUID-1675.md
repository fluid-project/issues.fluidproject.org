We have the beginning of some documentation around the event system:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/The+Fluid+Event+System>\
but we need more developer-centric api docs explaining the events supported by each component, when they fire, and what kinds of things you might want to do with them. A page has been started for this:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Events>
