The maven documentation says it looks in that place for it.\\\n\\[15:16:31 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> <http://maven.apache.org/settings.html>\\\n\\[15:16:34 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> I haven't thought of a use case really, but I didn't want to neglect it just in case\\\n\\[15:16:43 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> \"There are two locations where a settings.xml file may live:\\\n\\[15:16:43 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> \\* The Maven install: $M2\\_HOME/conf/settings.xml\\\n\\[15:16:44 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> \\* A user's install: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml\"\\\n\\[15:16:55 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> I'm confused too, but it worked when I put it in and doesn't work when I dont\\\n\\[15:17:09 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> which was a pretty good test for why it was needed\\\n\\[15:17:29 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> I assumed it had something to do with the fact that the web server runs as nobody\\\n\\[15:18:04 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> which may or may not be a good assumption\\\n\\[15:20:12 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> but you only ever need to do this on the server, right?\\\n\\[15:20:29 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> now, I only tried ...hey...stop anticipating my typing\\\n\\[15:20:36 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> i only tried on the server every\\\n\\[15:20:38 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> ever\\\n\\[15:20:40 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> grin\\\n\\[15:20:55 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> so this isn't really a good test\\\n\\[15:21:02 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> where else can we try?\\\n\\[15:21:23 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> In part, I wonder if we really need to try elsewhere.\\\n\\[15:22:14 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> and I would really like your thoughts on whether I should even bother with putting it on the windows option\\\n\\[15:23:26 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> can you clarify - that last sentence looks like it could be interpreted both ways\\\n\\[15:23:42 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> honestly, i don't see any point in looking at adding generality for something that we need only in one context\\\n\\[15:23:51 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> and worse yet, that we don't really understand\\\n\\[15:24:11 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> i agree, except for the fact that we are publishing the code for download\\\n\\[15:24:23 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> well, we're not publishing this as a product\\\n\\[15:25:05 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> the Builder is not generally something people want as a code base to use and extend...\\\n\\[15:25:07 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> ok...but the build.xml - is that a file that is distributed?\\\n\\[15:25:10 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> it's just something they want to work\\\n\\[15:25:24 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> sure, but my point is this particular feature\\\n\\[15:25:26 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> i wouldn't want to \"hard code\" this in\\\n\\[15:25:31 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> it's very specific to a context\\\n\\[15:25:36 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> yep\\\n\\[15:25:44 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> honestly, i'd feel better if we understood what was up with our server and maven\\\n\\[15:25:47 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> so what do you suggest as an alternative\\\n\\[15:25:53 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> i agree.\\\n\\[15:25:58 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> since the documentation seems pretty clear that this should work\\\n\\[15:26:12 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> and it does work at the command line\\\n\\[15:26:37 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> just not from within the web browser - so I'm pretty sure it is due to \"user\" issues\\\n\\[15:27:09 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> sounds like an environment issue... you're saying that the nobody account does indeed have a home directory, with an .m2 repo in it\\\n\\[15:27:12 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> but that it can't find it\\\n\\[15:27:15 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> is that right?\\\n\\[15:27:25 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> seems like it\\\n\\[15:27:41 EDT(-0400)] \\<colinclark> So I think we just want to get to the bottom of why that is.\\\n\\[15:27:58 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> but jamon may be able to phrase it better because he tried to explain it to me and I've lost the terminology since his last attempt\\\n\\[15:28:26 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> we actually discussed it in the irc a bit, so let me look for the history\\\n\\[15:31:20 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> ok - look here <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/fluid-work+IRC+Logs-2009-05-19>\\\n\\[15:31:28 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> at 14:13\\\n\\[15:31:42 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> that's part of the discussion\\\n\\[15:33:10 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> and then I played with the permissions as suggested, but that didn't help\\\n\\[15:34:44 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> in the end I believe that jamon said it was using the settings in the fluid user, not the settings in the nobody user\\\n\\[15:35:07 EDT(-0400)] \\<jessm> laurel: sorry, i have to borrow Colin's brain for a bit\\\n\\[15:35:25 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> ok...i guess without the brain, I'll have to get back to colin later\\\n\\[15:36:12 EDT(-0400)] \\<laurel> btw though colin, this is helpful. nice to bash this out with someone again...sometimes you get too focused on the wrong thing.\n"

In order to run the customBuild component we needed to point the mvn command in the build.xml file to the maven settings file. I am not sure if we should make this change for all users or if we should just customize the build.xml file as needed for our purposes.
