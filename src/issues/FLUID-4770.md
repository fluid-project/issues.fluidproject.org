So the width of the button should be dynamically adjusted as per the text or the text inside button should be conforming to the button size.&#x20;\n\nI have to look more properly at the normalise .css and foundaion.css code to understand this better.&#x20;\n"

When the last file is remove from the queue (via mouse or keyboard), when the "Add More" changes back to "Browse Files," the "Browse Files" button is positioned too far to the right, so it extends outside the main area. Hovering over it will move it back to the right place.
