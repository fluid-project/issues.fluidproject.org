Keyboard interaction does not follow the appropriate rules.

This is the appropriate behaviour:\
left arrow / j: move to left column\
right arrow / k: move to right column\
up arrow / i: move up one portlet or wrap to bottom\
down arrow / m: move down one portlet or wrap to top

Currently:

The only way to move to the right column is by moving up or down.&#x20;

After you enter the right hand column, you cannot get back to the left hand column.

Steps to repoduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Press the tab key until one of the portlets has focus.

3\) Press the down arrow key. Notice that this will allow you to move to the right hand column

4\) Attempt to use the keyboard to return to the left hand column. Notice that you are trapped in the right hand column
