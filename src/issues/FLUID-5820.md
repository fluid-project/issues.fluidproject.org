Performance work on invokers and listeners for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5796#icft=FLUID-5796>, <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5249#icft=FLUID-5249> have introduced a "scope chain object" into the instantiator's records for fast context lookup. This seems to be faulty in the case of an injected component reference:&#x20;

```java
fluid.defaults("gpii.deviceReporterLive", {
    components: {
        solutionsRegistryDataSource: "{flowManager}.solutionsRegistryDataSource"
    },
    invokers: {
        get: {
            funcName: "gpii.deviceReporter.live.get",
            args: ["{arguments}.0", "{deviceReporter}", "{solutionsRegistryDataSource}"]
        }
});
```

In the 3rd invoker argument, the context is returned as `undefined` even though the injected component is in place. It is resolvable via the reference "{that}.solutionsRegistryDataSource" which doesn't use the scope chain.
