Firefox 3.6 only has partial support for HTML 5 multi file uploads. As a result, we are required to use the File API's .getAsBinary() method to load the entire file into browser memory before uploading it to the server.

This approach has the potential to cause crashes in browsers with large file sizes or in low memory situations. The bug itself is in Firefox's implementation, but we need to add some kind of sensible file size cap for users of Firefox 3.6 so that we don't end up crashing their browser.
