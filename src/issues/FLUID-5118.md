This is because it is the original requester whose environment is relevant to configuration he provides. He cannot be expected to anticipate the destination site, and hence adjust his configuration for an unforseeable target - they may even be multiple such targets.\n"

When using distributed options, the IoC expansion seems to occur before the distribution of the options. The means that the resolution of {that} is based off of the existing component instead of the one to which the options are being distributed too.

This can be quite confusing, particularly for integrators who assume they are working with the options structure for the child component.
