Ability to see/hear/feel an immediate reaction to the program the student is building to keep them engaged in the activity

Description from co-design:

* Most students had difficulty connecting whatâ€™s happening on the projector to what was being projected on the screen
* Most students need hints/assistance to be able to detect cause and effect relationships.&#x20;
* Direct connection between cause and effect was helpful. So students were more focused on the activity

We could do low-fi design and dev prototypes
