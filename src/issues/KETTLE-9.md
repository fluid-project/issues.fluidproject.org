At the moment, a Kettle app can specify only a single includes file (specifying an array instead of a string for the "includes" property throws an exception). This means that each application has to copy-paste the standard set of Kettle JS includes into its include file.

Instead, perhaps we should have a global or standard includes file available to users, and allow applications to specify more than one includes file so that they can more easily reuse the defaults and supply their own includes on top.
