The CI pipeline for Infusion has not evolved over time to adapt for changes in the build process and other dependencies. As such, it's building Infusion 2 times inside the VM and running \`npm install\` 3 times – on \`vagrant up\` (see provisioning/vars.yml where grunt is called), immediately after that outside the VM and final time inside the VM once more.

According to [provisioning/vars.yml](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml), simply running \`vagrant up\` should:

* setup VM
* install node/npm
* npm install
* grunt (builds infusion)

From that point on, it's just a matter of running the tests with \`npm run test:vagrant\`
