Allison, Erin & Daphne to meet and come up with next steps for personas.  Once the final format is decided we need to put them all in that format.  It will be much easier to choose primary & secondaries once they are all in that format.  But are there still some we wanted to merge?  We should do that before converting them over to the new format.
