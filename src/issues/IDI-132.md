The Z-Index does not appear to be set properly causing the Outside-IN logo to overlap with the UIO panels causing the logo container to block interaction with the panels.

To reproduce:\
1\. Load the outside-in website\
2\. Open the UIO panel\
3\. increase text size to 2\
4\. with UIO panel still open, resize the browser window smalller\
5\. notice that the logo will overlap with the UIO container and you won't be able to use the UIO panels that are blocked.
