When using a screen reader like VoiceOver, the announcement of the scene position is interrupted when either the character controls or the play button are hit.

 

When announcing the same content using the key binding, the announcement continues when either the position controls are used, or when the play button is hit.  Thus it’s possible to have the announcement finish when you’re somewhere else altogether and the position is no longer accurate.  We should discuss why we have the ability to announce the position and whether the behaviour should match screen reader behaviour.  Solutions include:

 

1. Stopping the announcement if the position changes.
2. Preventing the use of position/play controls when the announcement is playing.
3. ???
