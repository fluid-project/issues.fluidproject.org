Can't close the UI Options dialog by pressing the 'esc' key

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html>

2\) Open the UI Options dialog by click on "Edit Appearance"

3\) Using the keyboard tap the 'esc' key

Notice that the dialog doesn't close. You either have to use the mouse to click the close button or tab to it and press 'enter'.
