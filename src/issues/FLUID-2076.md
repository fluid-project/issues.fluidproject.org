We are not sure the visual presentation of the "Click to edit" tooltip makes it stand out enough. Consider making the border darker or a different color, the background darker, or possibly reducing the padding around the tooltip so it looks less like the input field. The shape of the Undo icons in TinyMCE or FCK Editor also have a very nice shape to the icon - we may want to see if the icons in one of these applications are open source and available for us to adapt.
