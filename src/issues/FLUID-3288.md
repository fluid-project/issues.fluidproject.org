In Safari on Mac OS X and Windows:\
When using the keyboard to move items, once the item is moved once, the fact that the Ctrl key is still held down seems to be forgotten. The arrow key must be pressed again to restore the status, and then yet again to actually move.

To reproduce:\
1\) Open any reorderer demo, like <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/listReorderer/demo.html>\
2\) Tab to the list, and use the arrow keys to select something to move\
3\) Press and hold down the Ctrl key - note the styling change, which is appropriate\
4\) Use the arrow key to move the item once - do NOT release the Ctrl key

* Note that the item moves properly, but the styling has reverted\
  5\) Press the arrow key again
* Note that the styling changes back, but the item doesn't move\
  6\) Press the arrow key again
* Note that the item now moves
