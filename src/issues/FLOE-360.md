Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the first discovery tool demo

2\) Navigate to the contrast panel

3\) Enable either of the contrasts\
Notice that the active styling on the panel's icon is missing. The arrow pointing at the icon is still present though. The designs have a border around the icon and it is slightly larger.
