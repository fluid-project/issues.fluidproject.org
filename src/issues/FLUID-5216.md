We would like to create several small, self-contained demos that illustrate how to create preferences editors using the prefs framework, including (but not limited to):

* how to create panels and enactors
* how to include multiple adjustors in a single panel using composite panels
* how to show/hide adjustors based on the boolean setting of another adjustor
* how to work with schemas
* how to work with grades
* how to create proto-trees for various different types of adjustors

See FLUID-5215 for the overall goals of all instructional demos.
