Can't use the keyboard to activate a link in an inline edit field

Steps to reproduce.

1\) Open the rich text inline edit example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/tests/fluid-tests/manual/inline-edit/rich-text-inline-edit.html>

2\) Open one of the FCK rich text inline edit fields and add a link&#x20;

3\) Tab to the link and press the 'enter' key

Notice that the inline edit field opens in edit mode instead of activating the link
