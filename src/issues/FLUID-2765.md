Our progressive enhancement features rely on two CSS class names: .fl-ProgEnhance-basic and .fl-ProgEnhance-enhanced. These don't follow our standard conventions, which are described here:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Class+Name+Conventions>

Let's rename these to .fl-progEnhance-basic and .fl-progEnhance-enhanced, providing backwards compatibility for the incorrect names. This will require changes in the FSS layout file as well as ProgressiveEnhancement.js
