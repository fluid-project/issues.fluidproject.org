Antranig made the following styling suggestion for the Infusion documentation:

Styling suggestions - the current top-level categorisation doesn't have a very evident styling. I suggest that

i) The top-level items be moved from the right to the left of the top level pane - especially since we now have UIO there which clutters that area more.\
ii) The active item be given a "tabbed" styling (that is, a background which agrees with the main page background, and a continuous layout) to emphasise that it is the section that the user is currently in.

The other major styling issues I notice are:

a) The "inline code style" with the rounded rectangle is obtrusive and sometimes overlaps items on the next line and/or gets line-wrapped. I think we should do away with that and just have a styling based on font/colour\
b) The navigation for the left pane should have a "scroll-to" so that the currently selected item is always visible. For example, currently navigating to <http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesEditor.html> has the active item scrolled off the bottom of the left pane and so the user will become confused about their location.
