The Uploader demo, running at <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/demo.html> is broken. This is because it's out of date with the definitive markup for the Uploader located at <http://build.fluidproject.org/incubator/uploader/FLUID-3722/src/webapp/components/uploader/html/Uploader.html>.

Instead of cutting and pasting, the demo portal should load the Uploader's template via AJAX so that it remains fully up to date all the time.
