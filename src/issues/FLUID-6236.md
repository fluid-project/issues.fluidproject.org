Currently, Infusion is tested on our CI servers using the linux Vagrant vm, and its one one-off Vagrantfile and provisioning.

This ticket covers replacing that with a comparable configuration for the [Vagrant CI Plugin](https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci) developed by Alfredo Matas, and defining multiple environments, so that we can easily test in both linux and windows (even if we choose to primarily test one or the other).
