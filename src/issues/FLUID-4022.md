The important! tag is a problem as it's not over-ride-able, forcing the user to edit fss itself. With uportal, it is often the case that stylesheets are added in layers (site->skin->portlet), making fss on the site level especially frustrating.

!important is used in:

fss-layout.css\
fss-text.css\
fss-theme-coal.css\
fss-theme-hc.css\
fss-theme-hci.css\
fss-theme-mist.css\
fss-theme-rust.css\
fss-theme-slate.css
