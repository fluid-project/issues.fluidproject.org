The textfieldSlider component uses a model with a key of "value" for the current slider value. It's not possible to override this through configuration: the string "value" hard-coded into addListener() and requestChange() calls.

The Prefs Framework's wrapper, fluid.prefs.textfieldSlider, has a "path" option that is used instead of a hard-coded value, so that seems reasonable.

We should ensure that anyone creating a Prefs Editor using the Prefs Framework who makes use of the Prefs Framework's textfieldSlider can use whatever name they like for their model key.
