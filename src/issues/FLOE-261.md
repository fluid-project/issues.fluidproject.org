Dana's comments on the UI as of Feb. 5:

* progress checkmark vertical alignment should be 1/2-way inside and outside the icon boxes (see wireframes). horizontal alignment is good.
* make yellow indicator arrow dark blue, bigger, and closer to box (see attached)
* move bottom icons down a bit (center them vertically) so the space between the main white box and the icons is big enough for the pointer arrow&#x20;
* make the pointer arrow almost touch the icon boxes
* as discussed minimum text size should still show some fill in the progress bar
* maximum text size in the progress bar should still have a white internal border
* yes/no buttons on TTS page should be fatter (see wireframes)
* add min/max labels on top and bottom of progress bar (see wireframes)
* change text size icon and speech icon (once I get font icons to you!!)
