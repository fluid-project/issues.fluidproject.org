In order to take advantage of Renderer autobinding, some of the controls for the Video Player are being implemented as checkboxes when they semantically should be toggle buttons. Once toggle buttons are supported by the Renderer (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4573#icft=FLUID-4573>), we should switch the implementation.
