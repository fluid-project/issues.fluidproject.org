Right now, ProgressiveEnhancement.js is only capable of discriminating between different browser environments, and will fail on being executed outside a browser, for example, in node.js. However, it contains some basic algorithms which are useful in all environments, and should be enhanced so that it a) doesn't fail outside a browser, b) helps clients to discriminate browser vs non-browser environments by use of appropriate type tags.&#x20;
