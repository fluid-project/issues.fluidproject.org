If videoPlayer does not have any captions or transcripts passed in the options then the menus are still rendered only with 1 possible option to Hide/Show captions or transcripts.

This functionality is totally useless since there are no captions/transcripts.

Those menu items should not be rendered in this case and should be rendered only if options are present OR if some other component modifies captions/transcripts in the model.
