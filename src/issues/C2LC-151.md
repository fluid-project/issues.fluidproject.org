Ability to move items/features on the UI&#x20;

Description from source:

* The app’s UI laid out colours in fixed positions (upper corners of the iPad) which were not configurable so some students were not able to reach their preferred colours
* If the gestures required for bringing menus could be configured that would help with students who move their hands constantly and accidently bring up the double tap context menu
