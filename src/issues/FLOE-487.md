After ruminating on this, I've concluded it makes sense to convert / build out MyL3 to be a server-side Infusion project (using Kettle or gpii-express) sooner rather than later.

**Rationale:**

1\) Eventually we want this to be a full deployable service, with features like user authentication, non-browser storage of data, etc. The sooner we begin to implement this as part of the architecture the better, now that we are past a prototyping stage.

2\) It will be easier to take advantage of existing prior art from the larger community (the use of CouchDB / PouchDB via Kettle's implementations is one example).

**Things to look at:**

<https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server> has some similarities in being a relatively straightforward user interface that uses Kettle on the back end to persist data

<https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars> is an obvious candidate for templating

<https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle> and <https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express> - these are the two existing Infusion-based server-side frameworks.&#x20;

**Future work**

More detailed issues will be forthcoming as the work evolves.
