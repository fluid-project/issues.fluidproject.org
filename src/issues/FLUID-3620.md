Upon openning UI Options, the accordion appears too far to the right until hovered over

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/ui-options-fss-sakai.html>

2\) Click "Edit Appearance" to pull open UI Options

Notice that the accordion is rendered slightly to far to the right so that it is overlapping the preview.

Note that when you hover over it, it will snap back to the correct location
