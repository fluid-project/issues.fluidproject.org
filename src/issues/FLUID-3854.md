Keyboard focus remains on the "Add more" button after selecting files to upload in Windows and Mac.   It's working fine in Linux.  &#x20;

To replicate:  \
1\.  Use keyboard navigation only\
2\.  Click on the Browse files button\
3\.  Select files to upload and press enter\
4\.  Both the upload button and add more button have focus.
