Focus does not remain on Upload/Stop Upload button after activating it with the keyboard

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the demo version of uploader\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/Uploader.html>

2\) Add some files to the file queue

3\) Using the keyboard, tap the 'tab' key until the "Upload" button has focus

4\) Using the keyboard, tap the 'enter' key to activate the button

Notice that focus isn't on the "Stop Upload" button. The same thing happens after activating the "Stop Upload" button
