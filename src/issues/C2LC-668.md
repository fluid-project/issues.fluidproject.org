Announcements are not working on at least Safari 15.6 on macOS 12.5

Announcements are working on iPadOS 15.6

There is no error in the console, just no sound being made.

This issue was also found when working on the Fluid Orator: FLUID-6736. That issue contains details of the problem, including a bug filed against WebKit: <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243055>

A workaround fix is possible: set the voice on the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` instance before speaking. The following has been verified to work (it speaks) in the Safari developer console on Safari 15.6 on macOS 12.5:

```java
voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
u = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("hello");
u.voice = voices[0];
window.speechSynthesis.speak(u);
```
