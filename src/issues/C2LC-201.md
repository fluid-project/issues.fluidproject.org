Make the Play button into Play/Pause

Play:

* program and character will continue from where they are
* When the end of the program is reached, character stays where they are, any drawings stay on screen

Pause:

* execution will pause, program and character will keep current position
* User can edit the program while paused

Pressed Play/Pause while paused will resume the program execution from the point at which it was paused, and will run any changes that were made while it was paused

Cases to take care of:

* Program steps added or removed before the pause point
* If a step is added before the pause point, the pause point should move forward
* If a step is removed before the pause point, the pause point should move backwards
* Delete step that would happen next
  * Move to next step in the program, if there is one. If there isn’t one, then the program stops

- Delete all
  * The Play button is disabled
  * All program steps are removed
  * Character position and any drawings are not affected
- Refresh when paused
  * Character position and program execution position are reset
  * Drawings are cleared
  * Program itself is unchanged
