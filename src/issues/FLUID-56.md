Currently, the ListLayoutHandler maps both Up and Left arrow to 'previous' and Down and RIght arrow to 'next,' regardless of whether the list is horizontally or vertically oriented.

The ListLayoutHandler should be parameterizes, so that the user can indicate the orientation, and only relevant keystrokes can be trapped.
