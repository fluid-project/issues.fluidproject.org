Currently, whenever one searches for fluid-infusion documentation on google, the first couple of hits leads to the github repository of the documentation. There is nothing we can do about this, but currently there is no link to the actual documentation from the github README.md file. There should be, and in a pretty prominent place. Along with a link to the actual repository for the infusion code.
