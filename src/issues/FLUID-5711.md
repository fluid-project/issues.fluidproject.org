Currently, the core "standalone" Infusion framework can't be run in a Web Worker. This is due to the fact that we've still got a few stray references to the the global "window" variable in the code. In a Worker, there is no window, but the "self" variable is the equivalent global (with some of same functions available).

My worker includes the following portions of the Infusion core framework:

* jquery.standalone.js
* Fluid.js
* DataBinding.js
* FluidDebugging.js
* FluidIoC.js

Here's a list of the references to "window" that cause failures in a Worker:

<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L45>\
<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/jquery.standalone.js#L34-L36>

I also noticed that this function will pass in a Worker when its argument is "self" (which is probably a good thing):

<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/jquery.standalone.js#L71-L73>

I was able to quickly hack up a fix for this issue while testing. For reference, here's the diff:

<https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/3fbfa7e82b85cb9915fa>

This, of course, still needs to be worked up into a viable pull request.
