The Reorderer contains a number of very useful low-level keyboard accessibility features. This code should be extracted into a generally usable keyboard accessibility library, including:

* focus management&#x20;
* keyboard handlers for the arrow keys (horizontal, vertical, and 2D)
* keyboard handlers for activation (Enter, Space)

This should ultimately take the form of a jQuery plugin that we'll contribute back to the jQuery community.
