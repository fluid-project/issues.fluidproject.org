We will update the interpreter step logic as follows:

* The program counter will never be on an End Loop block
* The program counter can be on a Start Loop block
* When we step on the final block in a loop, the program counter is set to either the corresponding Start Loop block (with the number of iterations decremented), if there are iterations left, or the block following the loop (if there is one), if there are no more iterations left
* When an empty loop is being executed, we will highlight the Start Loop block rather than End Loop block
* When an empty loop is paused, we will show the pause indicator on the Start Loop block
