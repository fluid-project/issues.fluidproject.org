In IE8, when clicking on the timeline, every other click loses focus on the scrubber thumb.

To reproduce:\
1\. Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videodemo/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>\
2\. Click to a location on the timeline - notice focus is still on the scrubber (use Arrow-left / right to verify).\
3\. Click on another location - notice focus is lost. Arrow-left / right doesn't do anything.\
4\. Tab should put focus on Captions, Shift-Tab should put focus on Volume.
