The function call on line 14 of imagefield.js\\\naccept = this.accept.replace(',','|');\n\nonly replaces the first comma (the one separating jpg and jpeg). Taking the configuration above, the value of accept would be set to 'jpg|jpeg,png,gif'. It should be 'jpg|jpeg|png|gif'. The correct replace function is\\\naccept = this.accept.replace(/\\\\,/g,'|');\n"

A bug in imagefield.js javascript file causes a "The file \_\_\_\_ is not supported. Only the following file types are supported" on all valid images except JPGs.

This is a documented bug here: <http://drupal.org/node/352939>

Temporarily fixed this bug by modifying the imagefield.js file to properly accept other valid file types.

Waiting for an official patch.
