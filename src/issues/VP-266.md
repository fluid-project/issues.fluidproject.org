When trying to click the first transcript element, the transcript will scroll back down to the previously selected segment. This will only happen if the current transcript element is not visible within the same scroll view as the first element. For example, if the current selected segment was the last element of a long transcript.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) start a video and open the transcripts

2\) select the last transcript segment. You should not be able to see the first transcript segment at this point.

3\) scroll up and click on the first transcript element.\
Notice that the transcript is automatically scrolled back down to the last transcript element.
