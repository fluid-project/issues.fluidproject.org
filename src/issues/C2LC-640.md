C2LC-631 added functionality to enable setting of the character starting position. Extend this new functionality to also remember starting direction, when the character positioning controls are used to change the character location or direction.

For the Deep Ocean world with the Default, Light, and Dark themes, the colour of the starting position indicator does not match the colour of the line drawing (light blue and white respectively). Change the colour of the starting indicator of the Deep Ocean world with the Default, Light, and Dark themes to white to match the line drawing colour.
