(i.e. bottom portion is cropped)\n* After focus, the thumbnail shown is the bottom half of the \"full\" thumbnail image. (i.e. top portion is cropped)\n* Right-clicking on the thumbnail and \"View Image\" reveals that the thumbnail is actually bigger than the image being rendered in the Lightbox (i.e. the thumbnail shown is actually a crop of the full thumbnail).\n\nThoughts:\n\n* would providing a pre-cropped version from the server solve this problem?\n* Is there any way to crop the thumbnail on the client instead? (without having to resort to Javascript).\n"

It should use real thumbnails as well. And, since that demo is completely outside of the gallery tool, it falls to us to make suitable thumbnails for it.\n"
