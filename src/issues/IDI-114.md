The project logos are missing on institutional pages, such as <http://inclusivedesign.ca/research/ocadu/> . Even the placeholder image is missing, as on <http://inclusivedesign.ca/research/ryerson/> .

I suspect this is a result of the recent database migration: These images were uploaded to the site, not included in the github repo.
