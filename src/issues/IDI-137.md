When the screen is narrowed the header content jumps down (at medium width), creating a large gap between the header links at the top and the header content (header content should be vertically centered).  This jump was originally added to the styling when the header icon was inserted as a pseudo-element before the header title, and probably isn't necessary any more now that the header structure has been changed.
