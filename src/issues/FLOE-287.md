Currently the script in the EPUB 3 exemplar does not have a keyboard accessible version of the PhET simulation. An accessible version to be added to the EPUB 3 example.

Previous attempts at adding the accessible version have been unsuccessful (the canvas shows up blank, but elements can still be interacted with even though it is invisible).
