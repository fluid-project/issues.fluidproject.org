The reorderer feels sluggish in FF2, using the mouse. To have an understanding of the issue, open up a FF3 beside it and notice the performance difference.

It is most notable in the Lightbox and Layout Customizer examples:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/generic-lightbox/generic-lightbox.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

It may have something to do with the creation of the drop targets and or avatar.
