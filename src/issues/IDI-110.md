Greg discovered by accident that the IDI site doesn't show up in Google search results when obviously-related searches are conducted (he was searching for "accessibility research"). We should add appropriate metadata to the site to fix this. We could look at the metadata on the IDRC site for inspiration, as well as language used in the IDI proposal, etc.

He also suggests we add a brief sentence or two describing the site, to show up as a description in the search results (right now, text is taken from the most recent news posting, since it's the first text encountered).
