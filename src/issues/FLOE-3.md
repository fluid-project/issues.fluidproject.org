When an HTML5 video format is uploaded using the OER Commons authoring tool, we should inject an Infusion Video Player.&#x20;

To do this task, we'll need to upgrade Infusion using this branch: <https://github.com/amb26/infusion/tree/FLUID-4607>\
We should use the demo version of the video player: <https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/tree/demo>
