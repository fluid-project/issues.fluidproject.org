As part of the initial work to create a fully containerized definition of the application + dependencies, some basic retry logic was implemented in the storytelling server project's couch configuration grade (<https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-story-telling-server/blob/SJRK-60/src/js/dbSetup.js#L102)>Â - this allows the configuration to be resilient when dealing with the potential sequencing issues that arise when spinning up various containers, including ones responsible for operations like database configuration. (see <https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/)>

As this is generally useful functionality it should be moved from the server project to the couch-config project, with attendant test coverage.
