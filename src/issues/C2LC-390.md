The C2LC-372 work changed the alignment of the grid lines and character and path lines.

Previously, the co-ordinates were aligned such that the centre of the grid cells had integer co-ordinates, with the grid lines drawn at 0.5, 1.5,..

C2LC-372 changed the alignment so that the grid lines were drawn at integer co-ordinates and the character and path lines drawn at 0.5 offset.

This task will change the alignment back so that grid lines are drawn at 0.5 offset and character and path lines are drawn at integer co-ordinates.
