Opening video player demo in chrome triggers the warning:

event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.

Upgrading to jQuery 1.7 should fix this issue - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7825448/webkit-issues-with-event-layerx-and-event-layery>
