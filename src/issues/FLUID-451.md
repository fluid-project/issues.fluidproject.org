---
On the unstyled sortable to do list, and the scheduler list ( <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/scheduler/scheduler.html> ), the mouse cursor changes to text insertion point style which is inappropriate for the movement task - it imputes editing affordances, not drag and drop affordances. Recommendation: use the same four-pointed arrow as appears with tetheh styled sortable list test page.
