Using the primary and secondary scenarios create wireframes (can just be hand sketches or whiteboard pictures to start with) to go with the scenario and create storyboards.  Should have a storyboard for each primary and secondary scenario. &#x20;

These will continue to be iterated on throughout the design process and will eventually become part of the specification.  Subtasks can be created to this for each subsequent iteration.

Document on wiki in component design space.
