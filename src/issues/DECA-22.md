For post-0.3 batch processing we need to add support for jobs on the server. Its API should include:

* Scheduling jobs (starting a short, long or batch operation).
* Managing jobs (checking status, pausing, cancelling, getting all finished jobs).

RESTful URLs need to be used when implementing this.
