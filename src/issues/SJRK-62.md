Refactor the block grades according to the setup which was discussed.

The new setup will be:

* {block} contains only the model data for all blocks
  * {block.text} will contain the model values specific to text blocks
  * {block.image} likewise for image blocks
* {blockUi} will have the templateManager subcomponent
  * {blockUi.textViewer} will handle displaying text blocks
    * it will have a {block.text} as a subcomponent, similar to how a {ui} has {story} as a subcomponent
  * {blockUi.imageViewer} will handle displaying image blocks
    * it will have a {block.image} as a subcomponent
  * {blockUi.editor} will have fields shared among all editors
    * it will have a {binder} subcomponent
  * {blockUi.editor.textEditor} will have specifics for editing text blocks
    * it will have a {block.text} subcomponent
  * {blockUi.editor.imageEditor} will have specifics for editing text blocks
    * it will have a {block.image} subcomponent
