In various recent pulls we have see build failures that were the result of failures to upload either the flow coverage or test coverage reports.  This not only prevents later stages of the individual build from completing, but immediately stops other builds.  GitHub actions provides an option to indicate that processing should continue even if an individual step fails.

```java
continue-on-error: true
```

I propose adding this to both of the upload stages.
