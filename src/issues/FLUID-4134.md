HTML5 Uploader needs to conform to onFileSuccess and onFileError API semantics.  &#x20;

The SWFUpload onFileError event receives three arguments:\
1\. The File object\
2\. An error code which is SWFUpload's HTTP\_ERROR\
3\. The HTTP response code as a String. &#x20;

The SWFUpload onFileSuccess event receives three arguments:\
1\. The File object\
2\. The response from the server\
3\. the Boolean value true - response received from the server. (We will be ignoring this last argument since it will not be useful in our implementation)
