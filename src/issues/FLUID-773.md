Currently there are 4 levels of users:

* Unregistered - can only view content
* Authenticated - can create design patterns.
* Pattern Editor - can edit design patterns.
* Administrator

Missing from this list of users are:

* forum and comment moderator (should this be the job of a Pattern Editor too?)
* content author and editors (i.e. Page and Story authors) - is this something even worth considering since Admins are the only ones who need create this kind of content?
