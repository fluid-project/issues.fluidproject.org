This problem does not occur in Firefox.

If the browser is zoomed in Chrome, 3 tests will fail from Enactors-test.html. The following details come from a pane which was zoomed to 125%.

6\. \
1\. getLineHeight in px will report "8.97599983215332px" rather than "12px"\
8\. \
2\. line spacing in pixels will report the same.\
3\. The size should be doubled will report "17.95199966430664px" rather than "24px"

The ratio error is close to 4/3 but not quite. Rather than a factor of 1.3333333 it is 1.33689842072. This is likely going to be a tough behaviour to compensate for - especially since any reasonable person would have expected the factor to be related to 5/4 rather than 4/3.

This may be the reason for the report of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5384#icft=FLUID-5384>
