The Scene corner introduced in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-320#icft=C2LC-320> isn’t quite aligned with the Scene row and column headers.

<!-- media: file 9a447db9-d68f-4f10-8d28-8a98e0d8b469 -->

&#x20;

We have discussed fixing this by removing the bubble on the headers in a separate change and that should address this issue.

In addition to removing the bubbles around the scene labels, we should make the labels thinner and make scene’s border round.
