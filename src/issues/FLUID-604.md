In the uPortal example, a drop marker does not appear below the locked portlet despite it being a valid drop location. This only appears to happen if you are dragging the top-most portlet in the right column. Doesn't seem to be a problem with any other portlet.

To reproduce:

* drag the Bookmarks portlet left to the locked portlet so it is hovering over the bottom-half . Release. The bookmark portlet should now appear below the locked portlet.
