The ChangeApplier operates a non-standard workflow for adding events to its "base listeners". The listener actually subscribed is not the same one supplied by the user, since it undergoes wrapping by the applier.&#x20;

DataBinding.js lines 604-613 has

function adaptListener(that, name) {\
that\[name] = {\
addListener: function (spec, listener, namespace) {\
baseEvents\[name].addListener(wrapListener(listener, spec), namespace);\
},\
removeListener: function (listener) {\
baseEvents\[name].removeListener(listener);\
}\
};\
}

As a result, the "removeListener" call can only succeed when the argument consists of a namespace name rather than a listener. It seems that previous tests were fudged in order to dodge this issue - this problem was discovered when writing the "changeEvent" record type for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4850#icft=FLUID-4850> IoC-driven tests.
