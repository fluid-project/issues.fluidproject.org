Comment from Jen Bourey:

"The other thing I'd noticed is that while the arrow keys successfully move through the select list, typing a letter doesn't seem to have an effect.  In a long list like an enumeration of state or countries or something, I frequently find the default HTML select element's behavior useful, and I think I'd miss that in a select component."
