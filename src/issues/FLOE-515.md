The bold text in the body of the Intro page seems to indicate more info, or links, and is also styled exactly the same as the subheadings in the 3 Dimensions of Inclusive Design. The styling of this text should be changed - perhaps medium weight and/or italicized - to maintain emphasis but differentiate it from heading text and link text etc. <https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/index.html>
