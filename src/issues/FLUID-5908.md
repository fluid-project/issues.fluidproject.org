      "body": "Note that this bug was not observed earlier (since we do have several test cases for this-ist records, both invokers and listeners, in FluidIoCTests.js) is that it depends on the special-case resolution in fluid.event.resolveListenerRecord which reads\n\n```java\nexpanded.listener = (standard && (expanded.args && listener !== \"fluid.notImplemented\" || firer)) ? fluid.event.dispatchListener(that, listener, eventName, expanded) : listener;\n```\n\nSo any listener record which has arguments is wrapped by the fluid.event.dispatchListener process and so hides the \"strange applicable record\" from event.addListener.\n"

The following perfectly harmless construction, encountered in the GPII OAuth 2 server's "selection tree", fails after the implementation of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5695#icft=FLUID-5695> was merged in:

```java
listeners: {
....
            "onDestroy.emptyContainer": {
                "this": "{that}.container",
                method: "empty"
            }
```

The framework has succeeded in confusing itself by multiplexing the "types" of listeners - `fluid.thisistToApplicable` creates funny records of type Object with a function member named `apply` in order to quickly tunnel through the various dispatch pathways of the framework. The new "signature" to `Event.addListener` simply detects its arguments via fluid.isPlainObject and mistakes these for attempts to address its "options-based API". A language with a type system would save us from such blunders, but then it would curse us in other ways.
