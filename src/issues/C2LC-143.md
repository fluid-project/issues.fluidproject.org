Option to adjust touch sensitivity particularly for students who choose touch and drag and drop as modes f their interaction

Description from source:

* Touch sensitivity of the Promethean board was too high and caused problems with selection and dragging of objects
* Touch sensitivity should be adjustable, so they don’t accidentally move things around
