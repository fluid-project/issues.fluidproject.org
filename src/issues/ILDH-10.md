On the Inclusive Learning Design Handbook, the "Edit this page on github" should be less prominent.

Instead some thought should be given to:\
1\. Whether this link is relevant to users. Perhaps a link to contributor's guide is more appropriate.

2\. If the link stays, consider making it less obvious and less prominent.
