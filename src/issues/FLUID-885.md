The real problem is that, at least to me, it doesn't even look like an ampersand in the font it's displayed in.\n\nWhile checking this out I found that the edits are happening in a different font generally than display.  So on the daily build site Justin points to, the text is displayed in Times but when edit mode kicks in it displays in Arial.   In this particular case it isn't a big deal but will be when users are editing formatted text.  We know users want a wysiwyg interaction.\n\nI'm attaching a screen shot that show the 2 different fonts. &#x20;\n\nCan the component know what font the application is using for display of that field and use the same?\n"

When editing the text in an in-line edit field, the text appears correctly in Lucida Grande font (e.g. &); however, it is displayed with a different font style. Copying and pasting the incorrect style into another program (e.g. ms word) shows the correct font.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) open the inline edit demo page from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Edit one of the in-line edit fields by replacing the text with an '&'. Notice the font.

3\) Press 'enter' on the keyboard to close the edit mode. Notice the font styling has changed.

This also effects the display of non-standard characters. You can find some here:\
