When transcript is shown, clicking on white space in the transcript will jump focus to previously selected text.

To reproduce:

* Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Show Transcripts
* Click on a piece of text so it has focus
* Scroll down way below the fold to a spot with a lot of white space in the transcript.
* Click on the white space
* Focus jump back up to previously focused text.
