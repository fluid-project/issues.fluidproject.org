Title:

* Exhibition name (not in header) should be 18pt; subtext should be 14pt; exhibition dates should be 12pt

Catalogue panel:

* Artifact names below the artifact thumbnail under catalog should truncate at the second line with ellipses replacing text
* Said text should be 11pt

Exhibitions detail panels in general:

* "Read more", "View full catalogue", "Read all comments" buttons should be 25 pixels in height; button text should be 12pt
* There should be a dark, single pixel line above the panel headers (i.e., above "Catalogue" and "Guestbook")
* Panel header text should be 14pt in bold; if there's an accompanying number count with the header text, it should be in 10p

"Read more" exhibitions screen:

* Exhibition thumbnail should be 72x72 (not the big, wide aspect ratio one currently on there) – similar issue in ENGAGE-328, but for upcoming exhibitions screen
