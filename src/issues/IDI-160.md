Currently when new feedback is submitted, it quietly gets inserted into the DB. A notification should be sent to the BI team when new feedback is submitted so they can check the item for moderation / follow-up.

* [Use WP\_mail() function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_mail/)
* Verify that emails are sent.
* Must need SMTP port open. (Confirmed open)
* Who should receive the email?
* How does this email get configured? Hardcoded? Maybe to all users of a certain user role (i.e. Admins)?
