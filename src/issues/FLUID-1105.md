Sometimes a user will log on and will be shown in the "Logged on users," but the "My Options" menu isn't shown and an empty logon block is shown (which generally indicates that the user is not logged on). If we upgrade to 6.3 and maybe even 5.9 this may not be a concern but I wanted to document the problem as it's been reported by several people (and I've experienced it myself).
