As planned in the WeCount technical checkin notes at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQxLj77GzzbwWyj5lFaIY_RzOW2yDV79qtNP5wEm30A/edit#> in section for Thursday, July 30, 2020 - item 1 g (Project planning) subitem v 1, "Antranig will evaluate web scraping tools and possible locations/modalities to host data: <https://covid-19.ontario.ca/assessment-centre-locations/>

, we decided to apply a simple web scraping approach to harvest locations of Ontario Covid testing centres, in preparation to presenting these on an accessible map-based interface.

This task covers evaluation and selection of the tools necessary to go from data embedded in HTML into CSV, driven in a relatively manageable declarative format.
