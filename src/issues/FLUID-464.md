When dragging a portlet on\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/abstract/portal/portlets.html>\
a solid blue rectangle appears a few inches to the right, well away from the "real" location of the box being dragged. Purpose unclear for this - presumably it is the missing avatar for the moving portlet? - it miscues user into thinking the location of the dragged protlet is further to the right.
