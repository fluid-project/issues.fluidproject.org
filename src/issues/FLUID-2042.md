MooTool's Swiff  is a nice example of a self-contained library intended to handle the mechanics of JavaScript-Flash communication. Unfortunately, it is dependent on MooTools and as a result possesses a number of undesirable tendencies. We should build a Fluid component that is similarly responsible for Flash/JavaScript rendering and communication, but provides greater customization and portal-friendliness.
