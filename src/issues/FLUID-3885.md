The hefty refactoring that the Uploader has received in order to support HTML 5 has caused its options to change substantially. We should provide a means for ensuring that user options from Infusion 1.2 will continue to work with Uploader 1.3.

This can likely be achieved by using the Engage model transformation functions.
