When in the Story Edit page on the Storytelling Tool staging site, if I select a piece of text, the Orator will appear and offer to play it using the selectionReader. If that piece of text happens to be within the \<form> element of the editor (i.e. the block editing or metadata areas), then clicking "Play" submits the form and reloads the page.

**To reproduce:**

1. Go to the Storytelling Tool staging site's Edit page:Â <https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html>
2. Select a piece of text within the "Story Builder" area in the middle of the page (see screenshots for examples)
3. Click "Play" on the selectionReader

**Expected:**

The text is voiced by the Orator

**Actual:**

The form is submitted

**Proposed fix:**

The Play button should be updated to make it a "button" type button. I.e. on [this line of the component configuration](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/2b0e1a69bb74340da50ee3183bbf1f4ac8b5e20e/src/components/orator/js/Orator.js#L840) that defines the markup for the selectionReader, the ["type" attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_type.asp) should be specified (see "2020-06-02 orator bug fix.png" for an example). This is because if the "type" attribute is missing, the default behaviour is to submit the form.
