The approach that UIOptions uses is currently the best option.\n\nMichelled, Cindy and I discussed it, and we decided that for now, since we only have a single template, the tests will simply directly override the full path. In the next iteration, when other refactoring happens, we'll have a better idea of how the tempate(s) will be used, switched and customized.\n"

The path to the template file is hard-coded into the template filename option, which makes configuring a different path for tests impossible without having to also re-specify the template file name. The two should be separated out.
