In the NPM package of Infusion, we include a `dist` directory with builds of Infusion and built assets, such as generated CSS files.

In the `dist` directory, the following Preferences Editor files make reference to the OpenSans font:

* `dist/assets/src/framework/preferences/css/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.css`
* `dist/assets/src/framework/preferences/css/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.css`

And they do so via a relative URL such as:

* `src: url("../../../lib/opensans/fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.woff");`

However, OpenSans is not included in the `dist` directory and if the above CSS files are used in-place, the OpenSans font files will fail to load. The font files will be resolved relative to the location of the CSS files and fail to be found. For example at:

* `/infusion/dist/assets/src/lib/opensans/fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.woff`
