With GitHub Actions, I cannot force a build without creating a commit. In Jenkins, we'd just push the build button to re-run a job.

That means that whenever there's an update to Node.js, we don't have a way to update the actual containers that are running with the new image because we're using FROM node:10-alpine.

I'm proposing we pin the Node.js version here so every new version requires a PR/commit that will in turn trigger the CI/CD job that will deploy new containers.

I think this will have to be our strategy for Docker images going forward.
