Let's create a storyboard to explore whether our component should allow editing of structured data, such as links, where there is additional metadata attached to the text that is displayed. Would an overlay be the best way to allow editing of this type of text? How might this work if the text being edited is already in an overlay? (e.g. Announcements example on this page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inline+Edit+Storyboard+-+Allow+user+to+edit+simple+text>). See "Modal dialogs" conversation on fluid-work for a description of this scenario in the context of the Sakaibrary's Subject Research Guide tool.
