Use authoring tool to edit an OER content, maximize UIO text size and line spacing, scroll down the page, the bottom button "Next step: Describe" is out of the screen and inaccessible, although it still can be accessed by tabbing onto.

In IE8, the last authoring step, submit page is unscrollable and only the top half page is viewable.
