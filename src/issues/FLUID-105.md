The embedded licence text in the wiki (<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Embedded+Fluid+license>) is currently a template.  There should be a child of this page that has the actual text to use as the embedded licence.

Note that this is dependent on the urls for the actual full licences (in our source code repository).
