Steps to reproduce:

* Open the [Orator demo](https://build-infusion.fluidproject.org/demos/orator/)
* In the first paragraph select text starting from "Considering inclusion in all" until the end of the paragraph.
* Trigger the page reading to start
* Stop the page reading once the it gets to about the word "diversity" in the first sentence of the first paragraph.
* Start the selection reading by clicking the "Play" button in the popup
* Notice the reading continues from where it was stopped in the page reading, not from the selected text.
