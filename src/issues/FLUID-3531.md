In the Sakai example (<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/pager-site-setting.html>) it is not possible to\
check of some items in the first column and sort the elements by this column. Instead all checked boxes are reset to being unchecked.

To reproduce:

* Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/pager-site-setting.html>
* Mark a few lines in the first column
* Click in the middle of the column header of the first column to sort by the checked items
* A little arrow will appear in the header and all checked items will be unchecked.
