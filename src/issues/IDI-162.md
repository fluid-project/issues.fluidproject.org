When a Feedback Subscriber user is logged into the BIG IDeA site, they will see a link to the "Submit an Accessibility Challenge" page in the sidebar.

Because of the [issue FLOE-533](https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-533), categorizing the a11y Challenge page to appear under both the "Businesses" and "BIG IDeA in Action" will not be possible.

Therefore to work around the issue stated in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-533#icft=FLOE-533>, the link and text to the a11y Challenge page is hard coded into the sidebar-businesses.php file in the BIG IDeA theme. This is not ideal and should be fixed in the future with <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-533#icft=FLOE-533>.
