Long term, we discussed having separate controls for announcements and played sounds rather than having them both be controlled by the single audio feedback toggle.

In recent meetings we have discussed making the audio feedback toggle only control whether announcements are played.   The existing toggle would be updated to control a new variable that's only for announcements, the existing isAudioEnabled variable would be left set to true with no controls.1
