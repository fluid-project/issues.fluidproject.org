In Chrome and Safari, tracks with data urls – i.e. tracks with captions pulled from Amara – won't load. It is caused by a known issue in webkit:\
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143284>

Note that in Chrome, at least, adding a 'crossorigin="anonymous"' attribute to the video element allows the track to load; this doesn't help in Safari.
