Dragging a thumbnail will sometimes snap back to its original location despite a drop marker indicating it would appear next to another thumbnail. This is an edge case in IE6 and 7. Not reproducible on FF2 on WinXP.

To reproduce:

* grab Kiwano near the bottom-right corner.
* drag it downward to Kiwi
* slowly move mouse pointer down so that it is past Kiwi's thumbnail box and near Tamarillo
* Notice that the drop marker is indicating that it will drop next to Kiwi
* Releasing the mouse "snaps" Kiwano back to its original location.

Question:

* In this case should the drop marker appear next to Tamarillo instead of Kiwi because the mouse pointer position is closer to Tamarillo?
* Would it be easier to deal with these issues if the drag avatar is positioned centered to the mouse pointer?
