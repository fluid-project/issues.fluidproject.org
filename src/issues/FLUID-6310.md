In the current version (v1.0.0) of gpii-grunt-lint-all has a bug (<https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3233>) which prevents it from running if the project it is running in doesn't already include Infusion. Fluid-publish itself does not require infusion, so this results in an error being thrown when trying to run the lint task. 

 

A dev release has been cut to address the issue in gpii-grunt-lint-all 1.0.1-dev.20180726T123617Z.19bce0e
