Users who use keyboard with a screen reader would assume that disabled buttons are active and they are able to click on them even though nothing would happen. This is highly confusing and pretty bad user experience with conjunction <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-96#icft=FLOE-96> and FLOE-95&#x20;
