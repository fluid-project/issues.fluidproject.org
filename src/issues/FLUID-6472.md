Currently `infusion-nexus-demos` depends on a mix of smaller repositories that are in various states of disrepair. For widely published libraries we depend on, we should change the dependency to the newest stable version number. For smaller repositories created explicitly for the demo, we should move the code to fluid-project and clean up the code. The short-term goal is that the demos should build unproblematically under Node 12.14.1.
