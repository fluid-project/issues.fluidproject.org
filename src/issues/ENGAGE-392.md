VoiceOver user does not know that a two-digit number has to be entered for code. The two code entry boxes that afford a visual clue for this are not announced by VO.\
Likewise, when entering a number, invoking a button press (by double-tapping a selected button) does not provide a message to VoiceOver that the selected digit has been entered.
