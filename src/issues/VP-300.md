Currently, the Video Player WordPress plugin doesn't properly handle attempts to add more than one Player to a page. The shortcodes are added to the page, but when the page is viewed an error occurs, because the containers are not defined uniquely enough.

We will need to double-check how the container div is added to the page by the plugin, and ensure an appropriate unique ID is added and that ID is used by the generated script.
