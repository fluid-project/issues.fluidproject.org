A place to make music and assign each piece of music to a particular command/task.&#x20;

Â 

Details from co-design (Daniel): Select an instrument, then compose a tone/music for each move. e.g. CFD to move forward. After finishing composing, you can make a sequence of commands and run to make music. We could use low-fi design experiments like Wizard of Oz and low-fi dev experiments.A version of this will be tried with Sound Canvas, Body Synth and Bridges apps at Beverley's future sessions
