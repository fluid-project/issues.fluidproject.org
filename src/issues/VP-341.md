When a transcript is retrieved from Amara, the text properly highlights as the video progresses, but clicking on a particular phrase does NOT successfully adjust the timecode of the video accordingly.

It's possibly a timing issue: the data is fetched asynchronously, so maybe whatever code is trying to make the necessary connection is running too early, before the data is actually there? Just a guess...
