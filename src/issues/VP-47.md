In IE8, sliding the volume up and down moves the tool tip to a different location.

Unlike FF and Chrome where the tooltip is rendered in a fixed spot, the tooltip in IE8 moves up or down depending on the position of the slider / mouse.

To reproduce:

* In IE8, move volume slider to maximum
* notice that the hover tool tip is now overlapping with the time bar.
