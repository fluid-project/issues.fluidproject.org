A sourceless relay rule whose target is not the current component causes a failure in fluid.materialiseModelPath. Example was

```java
fluid.defaults("hortis.sunburst", {
....
        tabs: {
            type: "hortis.bagatelleTabs",
            options: {
                modelRelay: {
                   sunburstVisible: {
                        target: "{sunburst}.model.visible",
                        func: tab => tab === "sunburst",
                        args: "selectedTab"
                    }           
                }
            }
        },
```

This is sent into fluid.registerDirectChangeRelay which seems to have a somewhat sloppy test on line 831:

```java
fluid.registerDirectChangeRelay = function (target, targetSegs, source, sourceSegs, linkId, transducer, options, npOptions) {
        var targetApplier = options.targetApplier || target.applier; // first branch implies the target is a relay document
        var sourceApplier = options.sourceApplier || source.applier; // first branch implies the source is a relay document - listener will be transactional
        if (!options.targetApplier) {
            fluid.materialiseModelPath(target, targetSegs);
        }
        if (!options.sourceApplier) {
            fluid.materialiseModelPath(source, sourceSegs);
        }
```

This then gives&#x20;

```java
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
```

in fluid.matchMaterialiserSpec line 683 since there are no source segments

```java
fluid.matchMaterialiserSpec = function (record, segs) {
        var trundle = record;
        var routedPath = null;
        for (var i = 0; i < segs.length; ++i) {
```
