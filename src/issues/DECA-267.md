You are able to move to and open the other accordion panels, but pressing up/down arrow keys will require you to read line by line through a panel before you can get to the next accordion headers.\n\nDemo of the accordion widget in master:\\\n<http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/accordion/default.html>\n"

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Turn the ORCA screen reader on

2\) Launch the Decapod web app

3\) Tap the tab key until one of the export options has focus

4\) Attempt to select a different export option by using the up/down arrow keys\
Notice that the text selection moves but you can't use the space/enter keys to active the accordion headers.
