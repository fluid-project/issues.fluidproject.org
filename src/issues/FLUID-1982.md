We're using the swfupload.js for 2.2.0 which passes two and there for it fails when passed to the Flash component. When I modified the swfupload.js file to only pass one param, it worked again.&#x20;\n\nIt appears that removing the second parameter continues to work with the 2.2.0 Flash file, since it has a default value (the value which we want). So we could modify swfupload.js. I'm not thrilled by the idea of shipping a modified version of this file but seems like the only solution.\n"

After beginning an upload and then canceling half way through the remove file buttons are all disabled.&#x20;
