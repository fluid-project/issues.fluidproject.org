jQuery UI is (over)due to release version 1.6. This version will include the dialog accessibility improvements that we did and we should upgrade as soon as it is available.&#x20;

1.6rc2 was released on Sept. 19 with the following statement:&#x20;

"I'm glad to announce that finally, we decided to kick out a release candidate of jQuery UI 1.6. It's called rc2, because we pushed out a rc1 too early on Monday, and to everyone who downloaded that one or another early version of 1.6, a upgrade to 1.6rc2 is highly recommended. This is also the final version before the real deal, which can be expected to follow in the next days."
