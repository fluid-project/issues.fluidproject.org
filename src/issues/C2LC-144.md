When sound cues/music is added to interactions provide options to:

* Turn sound/music on/off
* Change the sound/music
* Change the pitch
* Control volume

Description from source:

* Adding sound as a supporting stimulus seemed helpful in most cases
* More than one teacher asked if we could change colours or sounds which wasnâ€™t possible with Sound Canvas
* Option to turn the sound on/off is very important

We can do low-fi dev prototypes and experiments
