In the past we stopped committing the package-lock file because we ran into conflicts which often result in us having to drop the package-lock file and node\_modules directory. Most of these issues occurred around the time the package-lock was first implemented. Weâ€™ve been using the package-lock file in other projects without issue for quite some time, so would seem like a time to bring it back here.&#x20;

Ned Zimmerman brought up recently that amongst the other benefits it would improve our dependency pinning to include sub-dependencies and not the just the top-level ones we can pin to in the package.json file.
