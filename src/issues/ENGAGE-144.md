In the test tasks for the view, the following is a description of the "description"\
A description should appear below the "Tombstone" information, taking up to three lines. If the description would otherwise extend past three lines, the excess should be truncated and replaced with an ellipsis (i.e., "...") and an expand button (e.g., a "+" or "more" button). If no description exists, nothing should exist in its place.

on <http://fluidengage.org/engage/artifacts/view.html?accessNumber=VIEW-1498&db=mccord&lang=en> there are no elipses
