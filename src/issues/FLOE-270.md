The wireframe for contents to be shown for tooltips: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/3rongwwjwcjjos9/First%20Discovery%20focus%20hover%20active.pdf?dl=0>

As per discussion, for now,&#x20;

1\. The contents for larger and smaller buttons on the text size panel can stay as they are (having contents "larger" and "smaller");\
2\. Don't add the tooltip for the help button since it does nothing.
