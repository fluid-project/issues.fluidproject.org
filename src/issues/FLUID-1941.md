Closing saves changes

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html#>

2\) Click the "Edit Appearance" button

3\) change some of the selected stylings, but don't save the changes just close the dialog

4\) Click the "Edit Appearance" button\
Notice that the changes made in step 3 are preserved instead of being reset to the current style
