The Infusion Renderer's fast XML pull parser is based on a SAX parser from XML for Script. This code was originally distributed under the LGPL license, but upon request the community granted us a zlib/libpng licensed version. The details are documented here:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Licensing+for+fastXmlPull.js>

As a result, our modifications are licensed only under the zlib/libpng licensed, and we should not include any references to the LGPL. The source code, fastXmlPull README file, and the overall Infusion README file should be updated to reflect this.
