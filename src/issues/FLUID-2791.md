undo and redo point at the same rich text content after opening new text in edit mode and canceling

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the inline edit quick start example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/components/inlineEdit/rich/>

2\) Open one of the rich text inline edit fields into edit mode

3\) Change the content and save the change

4\) Re-open the field into edit mode and cancel

Notice that hitting undo and redo displays the same content.
