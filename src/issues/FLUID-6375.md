The utilityÂ fluid.parsePriorityRecords will corrupt the priorities of any non-relative priorities (i.e. extremal priorities such as "first", "last" and any fixed or default priorities) since their string keys are sent into fluid.parsePriority as "index" rather than a numeric index. This, for example, will cause ContextAwareness records and adaptations to be misparsed in this way.
