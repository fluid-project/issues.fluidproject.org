Create a mailing list intended to address user support issues with the Storytelling Tool. We currently have the address "stories@idrc.ocadu.ca", though it's unclear who has access to this.

This new mailing list should allow anyone to send to it, but only subscribers will receive the messages. Subscribers would include tool developers, designers and other interested individuals.

There should also be a way for all subscribers to see replies to the user. E.g.:

* User X sends a message about an issue they're experiencing.Â 
* Support people A, B and C are subscribed to the list and receive the message
* A replies to X
* B and C should be able to see A's reply

Once the list is set up, the address should be added to supported versions of the Storytelling Tool
