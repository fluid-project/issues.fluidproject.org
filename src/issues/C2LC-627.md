I found the following when testing the use of loops with an updated Grid 3 keyboard.

Itâ€™s possible to lose edits to the number of iterations when a keyboard shortcut is used that causes the UI to update (such as using the keyboard shortcut for Play).

To reproduce:

* Turn on keyboard shortcuts
* Add a loop to the program
* Focus the number of iterations text box
* Edit the number of iterations
* Press the shortcut to run the program (Ctrl+Alt+p)

Expected:

* Program to run with the new number of iterations

Actual:

* Program is run with the previous number of iterations, before the edit
