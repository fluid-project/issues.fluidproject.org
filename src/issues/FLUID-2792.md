Saving rich text content, without making changes, will still render the undo control

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the inline edit quick start example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/standalone-demos/quick-start-examples/inlineEdit/html/InlineEdit.html>

2\) Open one of the rich text inline edit fields into edit mode

3\) Immediately save

Notice that the undo control is rendered, even though there are no changes to undo
