In working on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-453#icft=C2LC-453>, we discovered that the stop button styles result in a button that's too small to meet accessibility guidelines.  This ticket covers converting both of those icons to use the same Icon Button component that the world picker and keyboard input toggle use.

 

As discussed on chats, part of this is reconciling how we use the "disabled" property of that component so that the stop/refresh buttons are styled correctly when they are not clickable.
