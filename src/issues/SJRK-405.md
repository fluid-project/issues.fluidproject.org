Implement the server-side logic required to allow users to:

* Sign up / register
* Log in
* Log out

This will include:

* Session support
* Ability to create and save user information to and retrieve it from the database
* Associating published stories with their author accounts
* Continue to support guest publishing
* Password policy implementation

For the Minimum Valuable Product that we aim to produce, it will be enough to have the user automatically sign in once they register. A confirmation system (via email or similar) should be implemented once time allows.
