I find the slide up/down hide/show of the video controls somewhat jumpy and disruptive. Perhaps a very fast fade in/out would be less dramatic and easier on the eyes?

See flickr's video player. Also, it's interesting that they show the controls when the video is done being played. Wonder why that is...
