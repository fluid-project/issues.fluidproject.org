We have debated whether or not we should allow markdown support in the Story Tool. We have decided that we want to allow authors to use Markdown to add links, but full markdown support can introduce complexities and surprises for someone who may not be intentionally adding markdown or might not know how to use it. Giving the author the option to turn it on or off would allow those who want to use it, or those want to learn how to use it, to do so.

Question - toggle applies to all blocks, or to individual blocks?

Default state: off
