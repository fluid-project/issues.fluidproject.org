It looks like focus changes because the thumbnail image shifts 1px. It's as if the focus is being changed from the thumbnail to either the link text or the outer container?\n\nRe: No avatar.\\\nI get an avatar when dragging with mouse. Can't reproduce the no avatar bug.\n"

1\. When dragging an item with the mouse, there is no avatar.

2\. When using the keyboard to move an item, after the first move, the arrow key has to be tapped twice before the element will move. On the first tap, the styling changes.

These errors are not present in Firefox 2 (Mac OS 10.5, Win XP)

NOTE: on the second site, this only true for the nested items. The top level elements work appropriately here and it also works on this site    \

I'm not sure what the difference is.

See Fluid-Jira 400 (<http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-400>) for other issues that are caused with these same lists.
