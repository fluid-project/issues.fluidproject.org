Composite panels allow for the combining of several individual panels into a single one, which manages rendering and etc. Currently, a composite panel cannot be used as a sub panel. This restriction is due to 1) the need for a preference maps, which a composite panel does not have 2) the consolidated rendering process, where the composite panel manages the rendering of all the sub panels. However, it seems that there is a growing need to support such a thing. In the GPII's PMT, there is a notion of a more/less toggle which is used to hide extra adjusters. It seems reasonable that these extra adjusters should just be some subset of sub panels that are hidden within a composite panel.
