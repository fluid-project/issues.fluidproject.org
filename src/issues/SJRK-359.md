Add drag & drop functionality to the block reordering. This should be tackled after <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-288#icft=SJRK-288> and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-358#icft=SJRK-358> have been completed.

The [Infusion Reorderer demo page](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/listReorderer/) demonstrates drag & drop being used on individual list items, and can be used as a reference for programming this feature.

The nature of the block editors (with their many inputs, images, media players, etc.) makes the "grab the element anywhere" aspect a little impractical. Instead, consider a "move block" icon in the top-right of each block, where the "Select block" checkbox used to be, that can be used as a handle for dragging and dropping a block
