The way the AuxBuilder processes the "panels" property of a composite panel definition is wrong, somehow. If the strings in the array happen to be only one character long, it fails. The code is somehow parsing the panel names on a per-character basis, and converting them to 0s and 1s, and getting completely confused.

The x, y and xy panels in the minimalEditor example in this branch illustrate the problem:

<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/FLUID-5754%2B/examples/framework/preferences/minimalEditor/js/minEditor.js>

I'm getting a console error "TypeError: prefKey.replace is not a function" in Panels.js, line 159
