There are many unused or legacy folders that should be scheduled for deletion, I've listed them below:

/bin - was going to incorporate this folder for assets but used /js instead and left /images. now its empty.\
/services - was going to organize an api for VULab but it was depreciated in favour of other venues (frameworks)\
/tests - was going to hold tests for the /services\
/examples - legacy phpESP folder for help in skinning surveys\
CHANGELOG - legacy phpESP CHANGLOG, we can make our own now ðŸ™‚\
README - legacy phpESP README file, we're making our own now ðŸ™‚ x 2
