The functionÂ sjrk.storyTelling.ui.storyEditor.updateBlockOrder (introduced in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-288#icft=SJRK-288>) is designed to update the order-related model values of a block component based on the order of elements in the DOM. The blocks are accessed via the blockManager's managedViewComponentRegistry using a unique CSS class assigned to each blockUi component.

The method currently being used to iterate over the registry and find the unique class name is overly complex and should be rewritten or potentially refactored and replaced.

So maybe the first question is to @amb26 about whether there is an easy way to find a component from its container.

Perhaps this reordering behaviour could be the responsibility of a parent component that sort of decorates its children with the ability to be reordered. And there by managing the state of the individual reorderable elements.
