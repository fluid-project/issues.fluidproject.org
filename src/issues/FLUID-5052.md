Currently, integrators of UIO (such as the VideoPlayer) usually have to edit the header of the iFrame HTML to remove the references to the individual JS files and replace it with a reference to the MyInfusion.js file.

The re-writing is not necessarily unreasonable, but our current practice is to actually re-write the copy that lives in the integration's lib/infusion folder.

A better approach would be to copy the file, edit the copy, and tell UIO where to find the edited copy through a demands block, the same way the VideoPlayer adds panels currently. This is technically possible right now, but the integrator needs to know about the "iFrameRenderer", which seems unreasonable. Can we make it a little bit easier for the integrator?
