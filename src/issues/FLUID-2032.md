Cannot Tab to the 'Browse More" button with Flash 10, using FF2

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open either the demo or the server version of Uploader\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/Uploader.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>

2\) Attempt to tab to the "Browse Files" button

Notice that you the "Browse Files" button never seems to get focus, and you eventually lose the ability to tab or shift-tab to anywhere
