The Orator component is not working in Edge 44 (pre-Chromium). The component loads, and the Play button turns into a Pause button as expected, but nothing else happens. No errors are reported in the browser console to indicate what may have gone wrong.

This does not seem to be a problem with the [Orator Demo page](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/), nor with older deployed versions of the Storytelling Tool. It's possible this is related to recent updates in Infusion regarding <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6145#icft=FLUID-6145> and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6148#icft=FLUID-6148>, which are used in the current version of the Storytelling Tool. Filing this as a ST bug rather than component, in case the issue lies in the tool rather than the framework.

**To reproduce:**

1. Create a story and go to the Preview step, or publish it, or load a previously-published story
2. Click the Play button on the Orator component

**Expected:**

The Orator will read the story aloud, highlighting words as it goes

**Actual:**

The Play button turns into a Pause button, but nothing else occurs.
