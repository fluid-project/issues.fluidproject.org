This was a regression when we restructured SVN for the Infusion 1.0 release.\n\nOur approach for building Engage:\n\n* Don't mess with being able to easily run and rapidly develop inside Eclipse with Jetty\n* Create separate kettleIncludes.json files, one for in Eclipse, one for standalone deployment\n* Don't worry about separating Kettle from the Engage server code at the moment\n* Build a good, self-contained, production-ready WAR for Engage containing the following:\\\n  &#x20;  1\\. Infusion\\\n  &#x20;  2\\. Engage client\\\n  &#x20;  3\\. Engage Server and Kettle\n* Write an Engage Ant build script that takes care of minification and preparing the correct WAR directory structure\n* Use the Ant script to swap the Eclipse includes for the stand-alone includes\n* Use Maven to build the final WAR and resolve any Java dependencies\n"

The version of Xerces declared in the engage-sketches .classpath is incorrect, and should be 2.9.1 instead of 2.81\n"

The build should create a war file containing infusion, engage-client and engage-server.\
The war file should be able to be dropped into Jetty or Tomcat as is and the engage demos should work.&#x20;
