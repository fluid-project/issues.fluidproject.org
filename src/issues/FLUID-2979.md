The ResourceSpec object passed to the Renderer call fluid.fetchResources() includes a "nodeID" which is "the id of a node within the current document holding a template, for which innerHTML is to be treated as a template." We should probably not be requiring that mark-up have IDs - we should instead accept a selector. For backward compatibility, we will probably have to leave the nodeID and add a field for a selector that could be used instead.
