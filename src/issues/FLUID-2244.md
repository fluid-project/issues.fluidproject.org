This didn't however solve this issue. It may have something to do with the id. Previously the pager had been using the same type of page link to represent all of the page links. Now it has switched to using the disabled type of page link for the current page. This is what is causing the issue. It seems thought that even switching the disabled page link to have the same markup as the other page links doesn't help, which is what leads me to suspect the differing id as the culprit. The id's on the standard page links look something like \"page-link:link1\" whereas the current page link id's look like \"page-link:disabled1\". If the current page were using the same type of page link as the others, the id would stay the same after navigating to that page, and focus would remain.\n"

Pressing tab, after selecting a page, places focus on the first page link. Focus should be moved to the next page link

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the renderer version of pager\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/pager/renderer/pager-render.html#>

2\) Click one of the page links

3\) Using the keyboard, tap the "Tab" key

Notice that focus is placed on the first page link, instead of the next one.&#x20;
