Return to top link does not work at all.

Also there should be landmarks for users in order to quickly jump to the top header, TOC, content area and a Next Step button. Rich formatting or too many entries in TOC could make user tab many many times before reaching any of the sections mentioned above.\
Not every button in write toolbar has a key shortcut which also can make user tab to the write toolbar many times.\
There is no shortcut for user to jump to the editable area.
