There are invisible links hidden in the left-hand column navigation (in IE only) and hidden along with the Printer Friendly text block.

To discover, tab through the OSDPL and you will find that focus can be set on non-rendering items. Activating these links take you to unexpected locations on the site.

This is an accessibility issue and a potential security hole.
