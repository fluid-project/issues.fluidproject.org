I'm finding occasional minor errors in the text of the Infusion Documentation. This JIRA is a holding place for these issues. It should be updated as things are found.

So far:

* In Builder.md, there's a typo: "However, you'll generallyl want to use the simpler..."

- In Connecting the Parts of a Preferences Editor, in the second bullet point under 'Primary Schema,' it says "which tells the builder how to map the panel or enactor's the values in the primary schema into the panel or enactor." which has some structural problems
