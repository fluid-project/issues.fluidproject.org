Some vertical spaces taken up by browsers are not calculated with 100vh correctly, so when multiple tabs are open in iPad, thereâ€™s an issue where the Play controls area gets clipped at the bottom. For this version, we can have no clipping issue when no tabs are open, and for the next release, we can modify some css and javascript to ensure that vh gets calculated correctly.
