I received this bug report from Tom Pokinko and verified that it is indeed an issue:

"I was browsing the Preference Exploration Tool (link from the FLOE website) in Safari on my Macbook Pro running OS X Mavericks.

<http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/>

I chose to have the page read to me from the preferences at bottom and the website crashed badly. Error message: “Safari web content quite unexpectedly." Now even after clearing my cache the website crashes every time I go on it (I can’t change my preferences back to the defaults)."
