When selecting an inline edit text field on the Sakai announcement board, the caret appears at the end of the editable text rather then highlighting the text as it does on the bSpace section.&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:&#x20;

1\. Open URL: <http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\. Using mouse, click on a inline edit text line.&#x20;

3\. Inline edit should change to a editable  text line.&#x20;

4\. Pointer should change into I-bar and caret should appear at end of current text.&#x20;
