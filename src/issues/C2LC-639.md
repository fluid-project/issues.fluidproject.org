C2LC-631 added the ability to set the character starting position. Extend that new functionality to also remember the direction, when the character positioning controls are used to turn the character.

For the Deep Ocean world with the Default, Light, and Dark themes, the starting position indicator and line drawing are different colours (light blue and white respectively). Whereas for the other world and theme combinations, the starting position indicator and line drawing are the same colour. Change the colour of starting position indicator for the Deep Ocean world and Default, Light, and Dark themes to white, to match the line drawing colour.
