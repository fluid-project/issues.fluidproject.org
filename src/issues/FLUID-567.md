In Internet Explorer 7 under Windows XP: \
1\) Queue up five files in the file queue. \
2\) One by one add additional files to the queue.

Observe: at some point, probably 7 or 8 files individual  rows in the queue will expand to 200 pixels tall.&#x20;

What should happen is that the file queue outer wrapper should become a scrolling area and that the inner rows should not change size. This is what it does in FF (both platforms) and Safari on the Mac.&#x20;

Note: this bug may also be present in IE6 and/or Windows Vista, not tested in those configurations yet.&#x20;
