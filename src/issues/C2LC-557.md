Currently, the program area is highlighted uniformly whenever a command block is being dragged.  If you release the command block while positioned over the program area, it will be added to the program.  If you release the command block while positioned outside the program area, the block will not be added.  We should add some indication of whether or not the block is over the program area, perhaps something similar to the hover styles used for buttons.
