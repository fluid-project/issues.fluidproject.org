System that lets users draw shapes using sounds&#x20;

* Tutorials are provided to new users and over time they or educators can introduce additional gestures/behaviours&#x20;
* An inventory of shapes can be mapped to sounds recorded by users&#x20;
* Users can then use a variety of sounds to draw shapes either on screen or with a robot&#x20;
* Sounds of a visual composition can be recorded and played at different speed based on the learner's preference

 

Details from co-design (Colin's Sketch):

Learners who may have limited mobility and verbal language communication skills should be able to express themselves in other ways and without always having to do so on screen&#x20;

* Learn cause and effect&#x20;
* Have fun and stay engaged&#x20;
* Empowered with agency in the physical world
