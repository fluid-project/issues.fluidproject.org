<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2650#icft=FLUID-2650> was escalated. The related jQuery ticket, <http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4539>, has been tagged as fix for 1.8. If/when we upgrade to jQuery UI 1.8, we should check this ticket, and if it's been fixed, verify whether or not their fix takes care of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2650#icft=FLUID-2650>. If not, we should consider applying Laurel's patch for that issue.
