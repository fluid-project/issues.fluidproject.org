When using tiny mce editor for inline text edit component with "advanced" theme tiny\_mce editor opens and closes first time the user tries to edit text. This happens because tiny mce. To reprodcude:\
1\. create a tiny\_mce example\
2\. pass {tinyMCE: {theme : "advanced"}} as the option when calling fluid.inlineEdit.tinyMCE()\
3\. run the demo and notice that component closes instantly after the first time it is being opened.
