There are some things we want to make sure we do in the design/development of every component (e.g. gather use cases, choose primary personas, create wireframes. storyboard several contexts of use, user testing, define keyboard & ARIA interactions....).  There are many other activities  we may choose to do in certain circumstances.  It would be nice to have a design process to point the community to and for our reference.  This is meant to be the 1st iteration of such a process defined.

This has turned into a shared task with Daphne and Jess working 2 different diagrams:  1 to show the Fluid overall process and where a component is in that process.  The other is a more detailed view of the process.&#x20;

A new task will be created for next iteration too to continue this work.&#x20;
