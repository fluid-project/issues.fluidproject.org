We need to implement an private container registry for added security, reliability and, possibly, speed.

Today everything is based on Docker Hub, a free service that stopped offering security scans lately (moved into their Docker Enterprise product).

Self-hosted:

* [Docker Registry 2.0](https://github.com/docker/distribution)
* [Atomic Registry](http://www.projectatomic.io/registry/)
* [OpenShift-integrated Docker registry](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html#integrated-openshift-registry)

Hosted:

* [Quay.io](https://quay.io/)
* [Docker Hub paid plans](https://hub.docker.com/billing-plans)
* [AWS Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr)
* [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
