In C2LC-575, we upgraded CRA script to use version 5.  The previous flow coverage checking we used in CI does not work with this version.  This ticket covers writing a quick script to exit with a non-zero error code if src and/or test coverage levels are not met.

This would use as its input the JSON output from the following command. Â 

```java
npx flow batch-coverage --show-all src --json --pretty
```

At the end of the JSON output are summary statistics, which looking something like:

```java
"statistics":{
    "files_in_directory":108,
    "covered_expressions":32154,
    "total_expressions":34892,
    "percentage":92.15
  }
```
