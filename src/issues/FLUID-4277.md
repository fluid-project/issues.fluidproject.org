Since the UI Options controls template was split into 4 templates: the top parent template that has DIVs for title, button, preview and 3 placeholder DIVs for 3 sub-templates that each corresponds to one section of controls, the asynchronous template loading issue was detected by unit tests (src/webapp/tests/component-tests/uiOptions/html/UIOptions-test.html).

The js errors below were reported at calling refreshView() in each renderer components that load and render the 3 sub-templates:

"Error during rendering - component with id textSize which has a queued decorator was not found in the output markup" etc.
