If you start your drag motion slowly (dragging using the image or anchor)  then accelerate to quick movements, the frozen thumbnail and crossed-out mouse pointer does not appear. If you drag quickly using a white area, the problem doesn't appear to happen.\n\nUnable to reproduce this exact problem using Firefox 2.0, but thumbnail dragging is laggy and not very smooth. However you are able to drag and drop despite it being a little slow.\n"

When you atttempt to drag an image, if you move the mouse quickly the dragged image will freeze on a drop spot. The pointer switches to a crossed out circle. Releasing the mouse button results in the image being placed in the location it froze at.&#x20;
