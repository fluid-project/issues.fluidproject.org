In recent work on the infusion docs repo, I have been carefully reviewing various pages.  There is a fair amount of content where entire paragraphs are placed on a single line.  This makes it easy to miss changes in context.  I can see many examples where editors have obviously attempted to break down content into lines of a reasonable length, such as breaking up a long bullet point into two lines.  We seem to have a mixture of content with no line length constraints, some with 80 characters, and some with 120.

I propose enabling the markdown-lint rule to enforce a line length, and cleaning up anything fails the lint check.  As a starting point, I would propose 120 characters, which is not too long, but which is friendlier to longer markdown blocks such as links.
