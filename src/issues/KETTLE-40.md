The current implementation of `kettle.dataSource.CouchDB` inserts all model data into a "value" element before writing it, and expects to read a data payload from a similar "value" element.  See:

<https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/dataSource.js#L510>\
<https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/dataSource.js#L518>

This is to avoid confusion with built-in fields like `_id` and `_rev`, but limits the reuse of this grade, in that it can only ever work with CouchDB records that follow this convention.

I propose wrapping both the read and write "payloads" in a call to `fluid.model.transformWithRules`, as we have done in other contexts.  This mechanism would allow the wrapper to be modified using declarative options.

I will add default rules to preserve the current behavior, so that no change to existing code is required.

I will also add documentation (in the form of comments) for the new rules that can be used to control the format.
