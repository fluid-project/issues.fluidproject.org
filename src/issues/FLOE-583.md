Expand on the information provided in the [UI Options page](https://floeproject.org/ui-options.html) of the Floe Website.

Some suggestions:

* first paragraph for non developer
* next paragraph for developer
* Say something about UIO not being the start for web accessibility, it’s maybe the second step after having accessible content.
* maybe have an aside to point to web accessibility basics
* maybe link to external blogs like the one from Mike Gifford
