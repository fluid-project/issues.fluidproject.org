At the moment, component developers tend to write a fair bit of boilerplate code to access known, named things from the DOM. If done properly using parameterized selectors, this requires several data structures to to be in scope and is often a source of omission errors.

The DOM Binder API should provide a simple face on the DOM for component developers. Components should only concern themselves with referring to the names of "interesting things" in the DOM, rather than the mechanics of finding them in a safe way. The DOM binder should take care of merging the default selectors with the user's overrides and providing the connection to the DOM. It should also shield developers from the work of determining if an argument is a jQuery, a dom element, a list of elements, or a selector. Thus, outside users can provide interesting things in whatever form suits them best, but the component developer doesn't have to manage the complexity.

A sketch of this API is documented here:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Architecture+Sketches>

And "vestigial" versions of the DOM Binder can be found in the Undo service.
