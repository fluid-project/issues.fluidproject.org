To quote from our desinger:

"When buttons or tiles are in hover state, we will have a stroke and a darker fill. For focus state, we keep the existing fill (we don't make it darker) and just add a stroke, for tiles the stroke will be black and for the Connect to Dash button it will be blue Hex#299DCE"
