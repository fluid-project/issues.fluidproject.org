If the src url to the video is a youtube url, the video player fails miserably, without any errors whatsoever.

To reproduce:\
1\) Edit the source of the VideoPlayer.html demo file and remove the referneces to the webm and mp4 videos, leaving only the youtube reference.\
2\) Reload the page (make sure to clear your cache, if necessary).

The video doesn't load, the layout is awful, there are no error messages...
