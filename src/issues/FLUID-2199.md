Tagadelic module was removed from the right sidebar because it was inappropriately displaying tags for unpublished content.

In retrospect, we should evaluate whether or not tag clouds are necessary once the current phase of work is complete. It is possible tagging is not required (hence only adding cognitive load on the user) if other forms of navigation are effective.
