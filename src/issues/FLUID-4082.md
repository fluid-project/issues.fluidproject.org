Using IE6 on Win XP with Flash 10, tabbing to Add More / Upload only works once.

To reproduce:

1\) Open the template file in IE 6 on Windows XP with Flash 10 installed:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/html/Uploader.html>

2\) Use the mouse to add files to the queue.

3\) Tab to Add More. You can't subsequently tab to Upload - tab returns to address bar.

3\) Tab again; this time, tab goes directly to Upload button.

4\) Tabbing again does not work.
