      "body": "We have removed the native controls option from the API, favouring a demands block for removing our controls when required. We decided on this course of action because we feel that it is generally preferable to use the video player's built in controls instead of native controls. The option was confusing and prone to breakage.&#x20;\n"

The API for the VideoPlayer has a "controls" option which can be set to "native" if the integrator for some crazy reason doesn't want to use our controls. Setting this options does successfully not-use our controls, but the native controls are unavailable as well.
