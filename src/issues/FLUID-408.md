In the case of the Lightbox, the thumbnails are the drop targets, not the container that they are in. When the mouse moves off a thumbnail and is over the container the thumbnail being dragged can no longer be dropped. I'm sure this is not the desired behaviour.&#x20;\n"

While dragging an element, the drop target disappears and the element cannot be dropped when the mouse pointer is hovering over the drop targets location.&#x20;
