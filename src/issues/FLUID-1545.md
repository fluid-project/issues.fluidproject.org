The main issue is, how is this \"moving against locked\" functionality meant to relate to our other \"immovable items in list\" situations - for example, our list demo&#x20;\n\n<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/tests/fluid-tests/manual/list/list.html>\n\nwe have \"non-reorderable items\" but the correct semantics there seem to be to move past them ( as for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-828#icft=FLUID-828>).\n\nSimilarly, in other \"portlet\" cases, the correct response is to \"move past\" - especially where this would permanently impede movability (for example, imagine a middle column consisting only of locked/inaccessible positions - I seem to remember a JIRA insisting that we be able to \"get past\" this using keyboard nav.\n\nSo it is unclear to me whether this use case is\\\ni) A special case relating to wrapping\\\nii) A special use case relating to a particular model of locked/immovable things at the heads of columns (perhaps scoped to ModuleLayout/LayoutCustomizer, or just a particular configuration of these)\n\nor both, or some further thing ðŸ˜›\n"

With this behavior, a keyboard \"up\" action on a portlet directly underneath locked content will not move up and a warning message will display (something like \"you cannot move this box above a locked box\").  Which also means that when wrapping is configured off, an \"up\" action at the top of a column does nothing, and the same for a \"down\" action when at the bottom of a column.&#x20;\n"

Keyboard reordering doesn't show error message when trying to move a portlet above a locked portlet

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Press the tab key until the one of the portlets has focus

3\) Using the keyboard navigate to a movable portlet and attempt to move it above the locked portlet.

Notice that no error message is presented and the portlet wraps to the bottom of the column
