When we published Infusion to npm, we noticed that the headings aren't being parsed correctly.

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion>

This is likely due to the fact that we aren't leaving spaces between our heading markup (###) and the text contents of the heading.

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluid-project/infusion/master/README.md>
