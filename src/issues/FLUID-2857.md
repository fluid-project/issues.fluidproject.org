In gracefully degraded version of uploader, can use the keyboard to navigate to the hidden "browse files' button

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/html/Uploader.html#>

2\) Switch to the single file uploader

3\) tap CMD-("down arrow") to move around the page. Notice that you can reach the hidden browse files button and even activate it by pressing the "enter" key
