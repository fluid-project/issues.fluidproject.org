Stopping to respond to comments on 4546's pull request.\n"

The default for this will be the current html5 strategy, better factored into its own separate component. This will be swappable with other strategies when playing other video types or using non-html5 browsers.\\\n2\\) the controls\\\n3\\) the captions\n\nThe subcomponents will have their own templates and be responsible for managing them appropriately.\n"

So now, the controllers subcomponent loads its own template.\n\nNote that this branch is based off of my FLUID-4546-controllers-refactoring, updated to the latest version as of this morning.\n"

The more work is needed in this branch to resolve the issue that the controllers container gets displayed even in non-html5 browsers.\n\nMoreover, the investigation shows that loading the controls template in controllers component could result in the js error being thrown due to the async ajax calls for template loading. A proper way might be implementing a templateLoader sub-component that loads in all the templates at the start of the videoPlayer. This way would also improve the user experience to easy config the template locations.\n"

As per the conversation in the IRC channel: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/fluid-work+IRC+Logs-2011-11-29> (starting at roughly \[15:34:43 CST(-0600)])

We want to get rid of the conditional code paths based on the strings 'custom' and 'native' and introduce sub components instead.&#x20;
