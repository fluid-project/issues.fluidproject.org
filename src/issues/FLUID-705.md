Currently, the reorderList(), reorderGrid(), and reorderLayout() functions are too loose with their container selectors. Here's what we do:

var container = jQuery(containerSelector);\
var itemFinder = buildFindItems(itemSelector, container);

The problem is that the containerSelector may not guarantee a single unique match. We're probably better off enforcing an API where clients give us a single unique ID as a string, thus guaranteeing that we can constrain on a single container, rather than a potential set of containers.

The API should change to:

reorderList(containerId, itemSelector, ...);\
and so on.
