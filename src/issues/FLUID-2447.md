      "body": "This issue is due mostly to the nature of sub-pixel rounding in browsers:\n\n<http://ejohn.org/blog/sub-pixel-problems-in-css/>\n\nWhats happening is some browsers have less leftover space than others, due to the different alogrithms they use to evaluate sub-pixels.\n\nA workaround is if you dont absolutely need flexible columns with gutters, you could use flexible containers which have less data for rounding errors and should fit \"tighter\"\n"

FSS.Layout.Columns of the flexible type do not extend to the right margin of the browser page - there is "leftover" black space on far right, with the amount varying depending on the # of columns. The amount of wasted space is proportional to the width of the browswer window.
