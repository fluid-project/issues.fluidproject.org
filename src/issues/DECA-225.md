Currently there is too much coupling between mountApp and startServer. To be able to start the server you have to mount an app and to be able to mount an app you have to get the resources from the startServer function. Move the resources into mountApp and return them, so that the startServer can use it. This will allow the unit test to just mount the app and not actually start the server.&#x20;
