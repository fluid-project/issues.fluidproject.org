Quick clicking the undo/redo link breaks its functionality. It will still change between undo and redo, but the value of the inline edit field will remain the same.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the bSpace example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Edit one of the inline edit fields and press enter to save the value

3\) Quickly and repeatedly click the undo/redo link

Notice that soon you get a context sensitive menu and the functionality of the undo/redo button is broken. This context sensitive menu is the same that appears if you double click plain text on the page.
