1\. Open [Uploader demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/) with IE 11 or IE Edge;\
2\. Use keyboard to tab onto the "Browse Files" button;\
3\. Tab again and the focus continues to remain on the "Browse Files" button.

With the fix for [FLUDI-6056](https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6056), the first tab focuses on the text filed and the second tab focuses on the button itself. However, these two focuses are visually on the same element, which gives an impression that the 2nd tabbing is not moving to the next DOM element.
