Deploy 0.7 to a subdomain of 'weavly.org', such as 'create.weavly.org'.

Keep the existing 0.5 deployments at 'build.codelearncreate.org', 'space.codelearncreate.org' and 'forest.codelearncreate.org'. We will need to change the deployment rules for 'build.codelearncreate.org' on Netlify, so that we don't automatically deploy 0.7 when it's merged to 'production'.
