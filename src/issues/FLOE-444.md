The demo has been deployed as a set of Docker containers to <http://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/>, but is using forked code for its containers. As master code becomes available in various places (GPII components and otherwise) the running containers and their corresponding definitions in the Ansible playbook should be updated.
