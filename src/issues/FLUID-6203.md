Currently the text size and line spacing panel components have very similar configuration. It should be possible to refactor a base grade for a generic textfield stepper adjuster out of these. This would be helpful for UIO+ where we need a Character Spacing adjuster which will likely also use a stepper for the adjuster ( [GPII-2429](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2429) ).
