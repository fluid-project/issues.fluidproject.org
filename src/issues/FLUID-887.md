When entering in multiple spaces inside an in-line edit field, the spaces are reduced to a single space outside of edit mode.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the in-line edit demo from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/>

2\) Open one of the in-line edit fields into edit mode and enter in some text with multiple spaces (or cut and paste this "there should be (          ) 10 spaces inside the brackets")

3\) Press 'enter' to leave edit mode. Notice that the multiple spaces have been reduced to a single space

If you re-enter edit mode, notice that the multiple spaces are still there
