This will be a fairly extensive entry. End goals at this time:

* holistically pull together resources from projects such P4A and the general "education through making" concepts at both a theoretical and practical level
* inspire educators (broadly considered) to make use of Floe, P4A and other products to design more inclusive making / hacking experiences in and outside the classroom
* provide detailed examples of prior art (the PHET/Nexus hackathon, the DEEP hackathon, the inclusive design code sprint...)
