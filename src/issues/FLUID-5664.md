The new ChangeApplier implementation delivered for FLUID-5115 has the capability of rebinding the JavaScript object reference held at "model" of a component, which was not possible in the original implementation. The implementation of fluid.rendererComponent doesn't react to such rebinding since it closes over the original reference at time of component construction. This will lead to serious errors, including the complaint that the "model is not present" if it was undefined at construction.
