There are a few things that need to be fixed when text size is increased in Open Author.

1\. The width of the content should increase so that the table of contents can show about 5 words on a line. \
2\. The background of the 'Next Step' button needs to get larger.\
3\. The line under the copyright notice needs to move down. \
4\. The preview layout needs to be fixed
