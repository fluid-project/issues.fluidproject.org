Changing the sort order from ascending to descending to ascending ( and vice versa) will move focus away from the header

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Tap the 'tab' key until one of the sortable headers has focus

2\) Tap the enter key to sort by that header

3\) Tap the enter key again to reverse the sort order

4\) Tap the enter key a third time

Notice that focus is moved away from the header
