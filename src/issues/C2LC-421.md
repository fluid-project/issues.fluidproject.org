Similarly to <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-420#icft=C2LC-420>, changes made via keyboard shortcuts are not announced in the way they are if they were made while focused on an element.  This includes:

1. Adding a program step.
2. Replacing a program step.
3. Removing a program step.
4. Toggling audio feedback.
5. ???
