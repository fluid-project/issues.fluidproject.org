This issue was discovered at sending PUT request to CouchDB \`/\_bulk\_docs\` API in order to load JSON data that contains special characters such as "Ã¤". CouchDB returns error:&#x20;

```java
{"error":"bad_request","reason":"invalid_json"}
```

This is because, the function kettle.dataSource.URL.handle.http() in dataSource-url.js use \`data.length\` to calculate "Content-Length" of the http request. \`data.length\` calculates the number of chars instead of the number of bytes, which causes problem when a special character exists in the post data. To fix it, the data should be converted with \`data = new Buffer(data);\` to get the proper length in bytes.
