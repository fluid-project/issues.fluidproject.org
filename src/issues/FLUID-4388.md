Conversation (Aug 04, 2011) below:\n\n(04:18:27 PM) heidi\\_: cindyli Justin\\_o when i turn off table of contents, the hidden anchor links that get added within the content aren't removed\\\n(04:21:38 PM) cindyli: heidi\\_: seems the turning off just hides the div without removing it. that's probably the expected behavior. am i right, harriswong?\\\n(04:22:44 PM) harriswong: cindyli: i think so.  it simply hides the visibility but it's not a remove function. \\\n(04:27:49 PM) heidi\\_: harriswong but turning it on is an add function, seems like unchecking it should do the opposite/remove ?\\\n(04:30:51 PM) harriswong: heidi\\_: are the left over anchors affecting anything upon hiding the ToC?\\\n(04:32:19 PM) heidi\\_: harriswong unused, unnecessary mark up? confusing links to screen readers? not sure how that affects things\\\n(04:32:33 PM) heidi\\_: just seems a little messy to leave them behind, when they are meaningless\\\n(04:33:36 PM) harriswong: heidi\\_: Then let's create a jira for it and have them removed.\n"
