Long pressing and/or slowly moving your finger over various elements will cause Safari to select an element. A context menu appears which is confusing.

This affects the following elements:

1. Program steps in the program sequence container.
2. The scene.
3. The stop button (when disabled)
4. Expanded add node buttons
5. Any scene column or row header.
6. The program header
7. The "Weavly" text.
