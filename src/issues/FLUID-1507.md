The drop target is wider than the column it is in

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Drag a portal so that a drop target in the left column is displayed.

Notice that the drop target appears wider than the column it is in.
