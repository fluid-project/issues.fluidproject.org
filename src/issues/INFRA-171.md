Do you know if you can reproduce the problem in Confluence \r\n6.8.1? This test should be done in new pages instead of existing ones.\r\nThe bug would not fix the problem in case the page was edited before 6.8.0.\n```\n"

Issue introduced in Confluence 6.7.2 and fixed in 6.8.0 went unnoticed. Links to attachments in this page (and likely others) are broken:
