Branch for loops work.

Process:

* A branch for this JIRA will live in the upstream repo
* A PR for this JIRA will be used to track discussions on the overall looping work
* Individual tasks for looping will be done in their own branches and PRs will be opened to merge them into the branch for this JIRA
* Those PRs will be merged as a priority
