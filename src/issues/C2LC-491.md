To reproduce:

* <https://develop-0-9-1--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=0.9.1&t=mixed&w=Sketchpad&p=&c=aab&a=123456ABDabd>
* Add ‘Forward 1’ to the program
* Open the Actions Show/Hide Panel and hide ‘Forward 1’

 

Expected:

* It should not be possible to hide ‘Forward 1’ as it is used in the program

 

Actual:

* ‘Forward 1’ can he hidden in the Actions Panel

 

If Weavly is reloaded with a program, then those Actions used in the program cannot be hidden.
