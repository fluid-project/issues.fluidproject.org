We do not currently have any way of knowing the number of users of the 'build.codelearncreate.org' deployed on Netlify. For other IDRC sites, we are using Matomo Analytics.

Investigate the use of Matomo Analytics in Weavly.

Some notes from discussion in the C2LC General room on matrix 2021-03-09:

```
greatislander:
I think there's Matomo analytics
It is set up on most of the static sites, I can checkâ€” It's possible Gio didn't set it up on this one though since it's not in the inclusive-design or fluid-project orgs
No, there's nothing set up. It would be fairly trivial (10 minutes) to add a Matomo property on https://analytics.inclusivedesign.ca/ and add a tracking code
Would that be helpful?
oh now I'm seeing you are talking about the coding environment, not the static site
I think the answer is the same :)
I don't know enough about the coding environment to know how one would integrate a Matomo tracking code but it can't be that hard (famous last words)

sbates:
thanks for the info greatislander

greatislander:
Looks like this: https://github.com/fluid-project/trivet/blob/main/src/assets/scripts/matomo.js

There are two steps:

1. Create a property for the URL in our Matomo install (Gio or I can do this, I think)
2. Add that code with the correct ID to the site for which you want analytics

sbates:
looking that the code: some config is stored in window._paq and then we add a <script> element that injects some JavaScript from https://analytics.inclusivedesign.ca/matomo.js
is that right?

greatislander:
Exactly
The coding environment is built with React, yes? This might be relevant

sbates:
yes, React

greatislander:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datapunt/matomo-tracker-react
This is the recommended integration for React applications
