Currently the tooltip component takes in an option for "items" which gets passed down to the widgetOptions and eventually makes it way directly into the underlying jQuery UI tooltip widget. The items option is used to define which elements should show the tooltip. <http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-items>

The default in Tooltips.js is set to "\*", which means all elements. The result of this is that if a tooltip is set for an element that has child elements, a new tooltip is created as the mouse passes over each of these DOM elements instead of just the parent. (see: <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-361#icft=FLOE-361>)

An alternative solution could be to make use of the idToConent to calculate the correct elements, by ID, to use for the items. However, because the tooltip supports both idToContent and a straight content model the items option is still required for the latter case. We will need to have appropriate logic to know when to attempt to calculate the items as well as the ability to update the items if any of the ID's in the idToContent model object are modified after initialization.
