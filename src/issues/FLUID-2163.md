This is a standard page which is held in the main Sakai repository at <https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/ux/trunk/uxportal/src/main/webapp/site_setting_members.html> - various implementations have been produced using yui pager, jqgrid, tablesorter, etc. It would be useful to produce our own implementation of this screen to show how we are better.
