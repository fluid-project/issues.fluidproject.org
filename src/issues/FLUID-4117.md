1\. Use Chrome to open <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/demo.html>, or the infusion-1.3.1-src.zip from <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Release+Package+QA+Test+Plan>.\
2\. Upload 1 file, click "Upload"\
3\. Expected file uploaded, "Upload" button grey out. \
4\. Press "Enter" on keyboard, "Upload" button will light up and gain focus.\
5\. Press "Enter" on keyboard, "Stop Upload" shows up when it has nothing to upload.

4 and 5 are unexpected behaviors.
