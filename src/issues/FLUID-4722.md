The semantic implemented is that listeners that are registered **BY** any component - that is - which appear in its configuration - are cleared when the component is cleared - whether the listeners actually bind onto the cleared component or not.\n"

There is a lingering issue where there might be some additional framework support necessary at the time when the component is being cleared away. In particular this issue is very evident when the component that is being cleared attached listener(s) to the event(s) that have longer lifecycle that the component itself. Even though the component will be cleared away, the listener that is nothing but a function object is still present and will be executed on event fire.

Proposed solution would require an addition of another lifecycle function that is only executed on the component clearance - a so called clearFunction. This function is the last point where there's a chance to remove such listeners. Also, we can impose an informal contract where the user would not need to declare such clear function if the listener(s) are specified declaratively and with a namespace. For that to work we would need to implement a "default" clearFunction for "fluid.eventedComponent" grade that will automatically clear all such listeners from the component.

Here's a pasted patch that I used in cspace's infusion :\
