Be sure to update the version number, the zip file names (which include the version number), the "What's New" section with a list of features of the release, folder hierarchy if it has changed at all (e.g. new sample-code folders added), the list of supported browsers if it has changed, and the "Known Issues" section with highlights of the known issues.
