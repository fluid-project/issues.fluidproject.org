Now we have started issuing pulls against maintenance branches such as 3.x and shortly 4.x, it would be helpful to have CI run on these branches. As per conversation in #fluid-tech on 2022-09-05 <https://matrix.to/#/!JcoHDrfLedPQdFhAXn:matrix.org/$aSwHMWw8wNdoou9HrP5l6fZJRJDbCsKFjHIC-aKKGB0?via=matrix.org> we should adjust ci-build.yml to run on all pulls against institutional branches
