Broadly speaking, these grades should provide facilities to:

* monitor changes by a user to their preferences
* record changes to the preference including what was was changed, what value was it changed to, when was it changed

The data model of these grades should conform to that used by the preference sets in other contexts (the one rooted in the Access4All standard).

The Learning Dashboard prototype has some UIO-based work that could feed into this.
