The event optimisation work committed as part of FLUID-4776 introduced a regression. Where more than one listener for an event is supplied as a "bare global function name" (with no namespace record or literal function handle, etc.), only the last such listener will be honoured.

This problem was encountered in videoPlayer work, where a grade structure for fluid.videoPlayer.languageMenu accumulated two such listeners.
