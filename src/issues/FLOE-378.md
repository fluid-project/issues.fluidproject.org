The way to input letters in upper case on tablets is basically the same flow as having sticky keys on with desktops: Press the "arrow up" key then the next press on letters input upper case.&#x20;

1\. Turning on/off sticky keys feature doesn't make difference on tablets;\
2\. Pressing the "arrow up" key doesn't trigger the "SHIFT" flag to show within the input field;\
3\. The message on the panel is no longer valid on tablets: With Sticky Keys on, type % by first pressing the Shift key and then the 5 key.
