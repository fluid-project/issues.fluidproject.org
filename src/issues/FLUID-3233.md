This is not doable because the way at server side to trigger the download is, first of all, send http header telling the browser that this response is for download, secondly, all the server output following this http header is the content of the downloaded file. All the redirection or whatever message after the download content will be considered as a part of the download content.\n\nAfter browsing through a few download site like sourceforge and download.com, a general solution is to change the message to \"The download will start shortly ...\" and the page stays as it is before and after download.\n"

If the status is \"ready\", the client should hide the spinner, and then immediately download the zip file (e.g. by setting the window\\.location to the URL)\\\n4\\.

New unit tests for the changes at both sides. Improved server-side unit test structure:\\\n3.1 added one general test script to include all individual unit test scripts;\\\n3.2 added a config file to define all the paths and constants used in server test cases;\\\n3.3 wrote a Simple Test (the PHP unit test software used by infusion builder) skin to display what test cases are run.\n\nSome remain issues are:\\\n1\\. In firefox, the spinner only spins the first time after the page refresh. After then, the spinner no longer spins.

This suggestion is tried but doesn't help because ajax swallows the http header and the download dialog would not be popped up.\n\nIn the end, the empty iframe comes into the play. Instead of using window\\.location = \"download.php\", now we use:\n\nthat.locate(\"downloadFrame\").attr('src', \"../php/download.php?path=\"+data);\n\nProblem solved!\n"

After a package has been downloaded, the progress on "Preparing your download..." continues. Maybe there should be a "Thank you for downloading infusion" message.&#x20;
