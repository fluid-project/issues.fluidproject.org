When writing "new-style" integral bindings, it can often be useful to relay from constant values. Historically we wrote these inline in the initial model definition - however, not only is this not targettedly overrideable via namespaces, but also it is inconvenient when the model path becomes deeply nested.

We would like to write definitions like the following:

```java
modelRelay: {
         type: {
            value: "range",
            target: "dom.container.attrs.type"
        }
```

but instead we need a bizarre locution like

```java
modelRelay: {
        type: {
            source: "",
            target: "dom.container.attrs.type",
            func: () => "range"
        }
```

since we must have a populated "source" definition. Note we can't simply reuse "source" for this since it interprets all bare string values as model paths.
