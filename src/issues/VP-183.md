The scrubber thumb does not look like the original design. Specifically:

1\. Remove the default hover styling for the scrubber (a blue border line in Safari)\
2\. Style a scrubber handle (especially for the high contrast themes)\
3\. Style scrubber handle and scrubber when it is in focus\
4\. Add a carrot. (should be visible on the second screenshot)

For the design, see:\
