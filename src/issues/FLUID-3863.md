Currently, the keyboard accessibility plugin automatically "wraps" around the list of selectable items as you arrow past one end or the other. In many circumstances, this is quite desirable, but there may be some cases in which it is not (case in point: the five-star widget in the new demo. The designers have asked for no-wrap). It might be nice to have an option to turn this wrapping off.
