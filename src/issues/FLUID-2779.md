You should be able to make use of these classes to create the appropriate styles needed.&#x20;\n"

The cursor over the current page number, disabled previous and next page links on the Pager ([renderer version](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/pager/)) is a hand but should have a default "over text" cursor look (i.e. arrow)
