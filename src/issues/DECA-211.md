Currently to work around this issue, all images are first converted to tiff. However, it would be more efficient to just have genpdf able to properly handle all png and jpeg files.&#x20;

It is still unclear what it is about certain jpeg and png files that cause the issue, as some do work. However, it seems to happen most with irregular layout with images and images with little or no text. (e.g. a regular photo).
