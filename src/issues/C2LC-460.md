In performing QA on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-451#icft=C2LC-451>, I noticed some issues with the spaceship icon in the character position controls.  In all but the contrast theme, the body of the ship really blends into the background.

There are similar issues with the jeep icon in the Jungle world, particularly in the greyscale theme.

The Sketchpad world avoids this because the icon has strong outlines.  The Deep Ocean world avoids this because the body of the submarine is more strongly coloured.
