The Design Pattern input form requires some improvement to usability namely:

* better distinction between sections
* a more obvious "Required Field" indication
* better help text
* better layout / styling of image upload areas
* better layout / styling of pattern rendering

A side improvement could be to render design pattern meta information in a separate block so it can be distinct from the main content.
