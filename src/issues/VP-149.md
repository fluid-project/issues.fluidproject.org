      "body": "We decided to go with a CSS API for the size of the video for now. To override the default size, the integrator should include a style for height on the fl-videoPlayer class and a width on the following classes: fl-videoPlayer-video-element, fl-videoPlayer-video-play, fl-videoPlayer-overlay.&#x20;\n"

Right now, we programmatically set the CSS size of the video to the size we extract from the video itself. This does not allow an integrator to customize the size. It also doesn't seem to work well cross browser, since the videos look much smaller in Safari, for example.

We should allow integrators to customize the size (perhaps defaulting to the video's default size), and we should ensure that there is consistency across browsers.
