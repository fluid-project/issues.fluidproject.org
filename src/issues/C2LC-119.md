Steps to Reproduce:&#x20;

1. Open the coding environment with VoiceOver
2. Tab to the Connect to Dash Button and press it&#x20;
3. Press the cancel button when the list of available devices shows up
4. Close the error modal by pressing the Cancel Connection button on the modal
5. Repeat the steps 2 and 3

Expected Result:

VoiceOver should read the contents of the modal

Actual Result:\
VoiceOver does not read the contents of the modal

Notes:\
React Bootstrap Modal component has a property called autoFocus, which is setting tabindex of -1 to the modal on show, which will allow contents on the modal to be focusable when it opens. On NVDA screen reader, the modal is properly focused on show and users are able to navigate through the contents with keyboard interaction; however, auto focus seems not working all the time on VoiceOver – seems like it works when page is initially loaded and not after that. When the auto focus is not working, focus remains on previous component (in our case, the button to show the modal), and the contents of the modal is not being read by VoiceOver.&#x20;

There is an interesting fix to make VoiceOver to read the contents, which is manually setting tabindex of -1 to each div that contains the contents.
