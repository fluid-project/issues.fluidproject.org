Setup:\
Server version of the Uploader configured to navigate to another page after a successful upload

Steps to Reproduce:

* Select a few files, upload to server
* As they upload poise you mouse over the Browse button
* As soon as the files have uploaded and the Browse button becomes active again, CLICK the Browse button\
  &#x20;  Observe: behind the File Browse window, the Uploader will proceed to the next page in the workflow
* Select some files, and click Select\
  &#x20;  Observe: a second or two after the File Browse window dismisses, the browser will crash

I've done this twice... your milage may vary.&#x20;
