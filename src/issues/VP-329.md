With IE, when Keyboard focus lands on Video Player, it says:\
*grouping, video grouping* and completely ignores aria-label provided.

verified using:

* Firefox Developer Edition : 36.0a2 and NVDA 2014.4 : **Working fine**
* IE 11 and NVDA 2014.4 : reading *grouping, video grouping* and completely ignores aria-label provided.
