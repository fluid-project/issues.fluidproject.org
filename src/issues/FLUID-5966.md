When trying to upgrading to jQuery v3.1 ( see: <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5825#icft=FLUID-5825> ), it was discovered that jQuery has now removed the "selector" property from their objects. The "selector" and "context" properties have been deprecated since v1.9 and were officially removed in v3.0 ( <https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-deprecated-context-and-selector-properties-removed> ).&#x20;

The DOM Binder has taken care of re-adding these properties to the jQuery objects resolved through it. However, Panels.js from the Prefs Framework requires the "selector" property when reseting the DOM binder in sub panels.&#x20;

It is necessary to add the context and selector properties back to component containers created with fluid.container in FluidView\.js and with fluid.prefs.subPanel.resetDomBinder in Panels.js. ( the sub panel does a manual recreation of the container to ensure that it is sourced from an attached DOM element in the correct document â€“ e.g. iframe ) ( see: FLUID-4536 )
