Any “item” that fits in a single square is completely obscured by the background.  This is particularly an issue with the “landmarks” world, where all of the items fit in a square.

In discussion w/ Sepi, we decided to update the BlueBot icon to have its own thick border, and to make the character background for the "landmarks" world invisible.
