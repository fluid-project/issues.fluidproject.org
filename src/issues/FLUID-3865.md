Using FF 3.6, when focus is placed on the TinyMCE toolbar, it is invisible. Thus attempting to use keyboard navigation by tabbing through appears to be doing nothing, but in fact focus is being placed on toolbar items. The lack of focus styling is confusing and gives the wrong impression that the demo has broken.

To reproduce:\
1\. Start Firefox 3.6\
2\. Load the demo: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/html/inlineEdit.html>\
3\. Begin editing the first paragraph.\
4\. While still editing, tab repeatedly through the document and attempt to reach the editor that is still open.\
5\. You will discover that you will be stuck on an invisible, empty element just before the editor.

Affects both FF 3.6 on Windows and Mac OS X. IE8 on Windows is not affected.

The example on the TinyMCE website does not appear to have this problem.\

Keyboard work-around:\
You can hit "enter" to select an item in the toolbar. This would put you back into the textarea, from which you could tab out. You could also hit "esc", which would close the RichText Inline edit and give you back your proper tab navigation.
