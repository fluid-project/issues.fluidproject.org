The inline edit dropdown sample at <http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/tests/fluid-tests/manual/inline-edit/dropdown.html> shows a CSS issue to do with the positioning of the popup for the selection control relative to the initiating control. This should really be positioned so that the top member of the list is directly below the "select box" which is displayed - however, on most browsers the dropdown list tends to overlap the selection box about halfway.
