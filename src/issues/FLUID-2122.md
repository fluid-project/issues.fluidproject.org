"Add Widgets" and "Edit Appearance" buttons are side by side in simple layout mode, they should be aligned vertically instead of horizontally.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html#>

2\) Click on "Edit Appearance" to open the UI Options dialog

3\) Change the layout to simple, save changes and close the dialog

Notice that the "Add Widgets" and "Edit Appearance" buttons are aligned horizontally instead of vertically
