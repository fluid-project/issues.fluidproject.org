In Internet Explorer 7 under Windows XP:\
1\) Queue up three or more files for uploading \
2\) Begin uploading a queue of files in the File Uploader\
Observe: the Progress pop-up is initially displayed correctly but soon after the first update the Progress pop-ups background area only displays part of itself.  On completion the pop-up once again has a moment of correct display before being dismissed.&#x20;

Note: this bug may also be present in IE6 and/or Windows Vista, not tested in those configurations yet.&#x20;
