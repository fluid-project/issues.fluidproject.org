At the moment, it's not clear to our users what versions of our third party dependencies we distribute. For example, jQuery and jQuery UI. We do have some information about jQuery-related versions here:

<https://source.fluidproject.org/svn/fluid/components/trunk/src/webapp/fluid-components/js/jquery/ui-FLUID-readme.txt>

But it's buried in a place where no end-user will find it. Let's move the version up into here:

<https://source.fluidproject.org/svn/fluid/components/trunk/README.txt>

1.1-release-process
