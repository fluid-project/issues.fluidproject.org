Dragging tabs in FF2 on\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/unordered-list-tabs/unordered-list-tabs.html#>\
does not work properly; some of the tabs move above the base row when tabs are dragged, making it next to impossible to determine where a tab will be droppped, and dropping behaviour is erratic. Tabs sometimes go where the red drop bar indicates and other times do not.
