      "body": "Unfortunately, even with the current work on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-1148#icft=FLUID-1148>, this issue is still not resolved - it is more problematic than it appears, and some of the analysis above isn't quite right.\n\nThe issue arises because we are using \"natural DOM flowing\" for layout. Therefore elements (and indeed also the drop marker!) will naturally tend to appear \"just where there is room for them\". So the current behaviour is actually consistent, and undesirable - there is \"almost always\" room for a drop marker at the end of a row, but there is \"never\" room for a whole cell (since otherwise it would have appeared there). Therefore the drop marker always appears at the end of the \"first row\" (in Anastasia's walkthrough), but the actual item always appears at the start of the second row.\n\nIt's hard to see on the face of it how we could resolve this, except by some rather odd requirements on the way we create drop markers (or the way we conceive of cells). One way to do this would be to create the drop marker **inside** the cell which starts the 2nd row - however, this represents a form of \"DOM fascism\" and may well in some cases create invalid markup (imagine the case where a cell is a \\<tr>).&#x20;\n\nWell, actually, the above issue highlights some further problems - we could never actually have a drop marker within a table that was not itself a \\<tr> element. Therefore it seems the only way out of this is to add a parameterisation for the drop marker placement \"strategy\" as well as its creation.\n"

Using the lightbox as an example, if one drags an thumbnail to the left of the first item in a row, the drop target appears just after the last item in the previous row.  This position is, in fact, correct.  However, it would provide better feedback if it appeared at the beginning of the row that the user  is dragging "within" (in this example).  If however it was dragged to the right of the last item in a row, then the drop target should appear at the end of that row.
