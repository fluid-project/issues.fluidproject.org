scrolling table was added to fss-layout with these styles:

/\* scrollable table with fixed header \*/\
.fl-table-scrollable-container { /\* space for fixed header \*/\
position:relative;\
padding-top:2em;   \
}

.fl-table-scrollable-area { \
max-height:160px;\
overflow: auto;\
overflow-x: hidden;\
overflow-y: auto;\
}

.fl-table-scrollable-area table thead tr { /\* fixed table header \*/\
left: -1px; \
top: 0;\
position: absolute;   \
}

***

Make sure the naming convention is correct, will work generally (right now just used in uploader), then add an example to the FSS demo.
