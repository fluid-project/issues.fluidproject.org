This is done by specifying the \"preserve\" merging strategy at the options path holding the destructible thing (e.g. \"model\"). More work is required on \"component grading\" in order to make this automatically applied to options which have a standard layout.\n"

If a ChangeApplier is provided to a component through the creator function's options structure, the options merging process carried out by fluid.initView() doesn't quite deal with the applier properly, and subsequent requests by the component to modify the model don't affect the model properly. It's possible that I shouldn't be expecting to be able to pass an applier as an option, in which case fine, perhaps someone can advise me of an alternative ðŸ™‚

In the meantime, referencing the applier directly is a functional workaround:

cspace.myComponent = function (container, options) {\
var that = fluid.initView("cspace.myComponent", container, options);\
that.options.applier = options.applier;       //  <<==== workaround\
....
