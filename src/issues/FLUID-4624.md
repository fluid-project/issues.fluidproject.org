The structure of the new navigation menu:

Home\
Introduction\
Why is this important?\
What is the approach?\
Body/techniques/something?\
Inclusive learning\
Accessibility principles\
Learner needs and preferences\
Video content and learning\
Audio content and learning\
Authoring of content\
Content simplification

In above,

1\. "Introduction" and "Body/Techniques/something?" are headings rather than links\
2\. The link "Home" points to the old Introduction page.\
3\. Indentation should be maintained for the sub-pages.
