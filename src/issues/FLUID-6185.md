PrefsEditor, SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor, SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame stylus files used methods fromÂ Themes.styl to change contrast themes. These methods have been deprecated but the function definitions remain in Themes.styl.

The following functions were deprecated:

* build-themes-separatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame(contrastThemes)
