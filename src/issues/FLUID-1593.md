Grid cell avatars do not all display under the pointer.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Reorderer Springboards from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/Reorderer.html>

2\) Go to the grid example (example 3) and pick up a cell. Notice that the avatar is not directly under the pointer. Different cells will be placed in differing positions.
