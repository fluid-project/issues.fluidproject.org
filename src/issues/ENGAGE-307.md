Don't forget the Same Origin Policy: you can't POST via AJAX in the browser to a different server\\\n2\\. Writing a service that will blindly POST to any URL specified in the query parameters is a security flaw\\\n3\\. HTTP semantics matter. Don't GET when you should be POSTing\n\nI modified the server-side code to read the sendMyCollectionURL out of Engage's config file, rather than accepting it as a request parameter. I have not yet changed the client-side code to do a POST instead of a GET. That'll have to happen for 0.3 final.\n\nI'm also not fully convinced that a jQuery UI Dialog is the most optimal solution here. It works, but it's going to be slow on a mobile phone. Given Safari's lack of support for most ARIA roles, it may also not be the most accessible option.\n"

For Engage 0.3 beta, we will implement this "send my collection" action as a simple POST request to an external script. Hugues is implementing a script that will accept the user's email address, language selection, and their personal collection as parameters. He will then merge the collection with the user information in his CMS and send an email to the user.

Here's an email thread on fluid-work about how to implement it:
