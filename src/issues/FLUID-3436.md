If more than one identical, uncached build is requested at roughly the same time, an error occurs for all users but the first. This is due to the fact that both processes try to update the cache, inserting a new cache record with the same primary key. Attempts to do this subsequent to the first one will violate the unique constraint for this table in MySQL.

We can fix this by recognizing when a cache insert error occurs and actually checking the cache for the appropriate files, rather than just throwing an error.
