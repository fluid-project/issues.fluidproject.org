Boundary tests #1\
Test 1: Upload a File With a Small File Size

* Procedure\
  &#x20;        1\. Open the browser and navigate to the specified URL\
  &#x20;        2\. Using the mouse, click the 'Browse Files' button\
  &#x20;        3\. From the OS file open dialog, select a file that is approximately 0KB (e.g. blank text file)\
  &#x20;        4\. Using the mouse, click 'Select' or 'Open'

I created an empty test file in notepad and renamed the file text.jpg - the file properties indicate the file size is 0 and the size on disk is also 0.

I attempted to add the file using "browse files" and "Open" as described in the test.

The file was not added to the "uploading list"
