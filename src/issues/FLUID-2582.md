ProgressiveEnhancement.js is not included in InfusionAll.js because it is executed upon being parsed. Implementations that use components that rely on progressive enhancement, such as Uploader, must manually include this file in addition to InfusionAll.js.

This issue should either be changed, or at least documented.
