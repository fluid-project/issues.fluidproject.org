For some reason, the Infusion bundle that the VideoPlayer is using includes Uploader. The VideoPlayer does use the Progress component, which is included with Uploader.

We should determine if there are other things the Uploader actually provides, and if there's any way to get them without including the entire Uploader. If not, we should consider refactoring the Uploader so that whatever the VideoPlayer is using is made available independently.
