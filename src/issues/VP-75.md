Even when there is no error on this line, the issue is still persists. A separate JIRA should be opened for the observed behaviour above.\n"

Most likely it is because of the format of type HH:MM:SS.mmm which happens after adding this 1 extra millisecond while code seems to work when format used by VideoPlayer stays the same as the format used by captionator which is HH:MM:SS.mm&#x20;\n"

Hence the line described in above comment would not do much.\n\nExamples:\\\nOur time 00:00:04.03 and after adding 1 millisecond it would become 00:00:04.031\\\nWhile the time range returned from UniSub is\\\n\"inTime\": \"00:00:04.033\",\\\n\"outTime\": \"00:00:05.992\",\\\nwhich means that the match will fall into the previous caption.\n\nFurthermore some times were radically different. Example:\\\nWe have in our transcript file\\\n\"inTime\": \"00:01:00.00\",\\\n\"outTime\": \"00:01:03.18\",\\\n\"transcript\": \"we try to find commonality and connections.\"\n\nCaptions returned from UniSub\\\n\"inTime\": \"00:01:00.864\",\\\n\"outTime\": \"00:01:03.185\",\\\n\"transcript\": \"try to find commonality and connections.\"\n\nThe difference is 0.864 milliseconds.\n"

When you select a cue in the transcript pane, the video gets positioned at the cue before the one you've selected.&#x20;
