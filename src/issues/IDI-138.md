Because the header background image is fixed, it does not shift down when the UIO panel is opened or when the text size is enlarged.  As a result, the image does not fill the header container and a band of solid background colour appears at the bottom of the image.  This band appears only at mid-width (goes away when screen gets wide enough or narrow enough).

Note: in Firefox this happens (very briefly) even at default text size (because the default size is larger than other browsers).
