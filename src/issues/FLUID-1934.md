RSF Server featured a specially recognised id of "payload-component", which when applied, would cause the component peering tag to be displaced to a tag nested somewhere within the initial peering tag (that used for selection).

<http://www2.caret.cam.ac.uk/rsfwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PayloadComponent>

This functionality should be implemented and verified in the client-side renderer, as well as porting all relevant bug fixes such as <https://bugs.caret.cam.ac.uk/browse/RSF-115>
