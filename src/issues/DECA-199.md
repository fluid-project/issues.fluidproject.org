Often images a user wants to preserve the order of images according to filename (i.e. as it appears in the file system), but Decapod does not preserve this ordering if importing is done out of order.

Upon importing an image, the original filename is stored to metadata. The UI should allow user to see the original filename and sort it.

Interaction should be "undoable" in case the user wants to revert back to the previous sorting scheme.
