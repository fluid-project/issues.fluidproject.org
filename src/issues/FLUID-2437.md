Need to click twice on an editted field to open in edit mode

1\) Open the rich text inline editor example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/rich-text-inline-edit.html>

2\) Edit the any of the rich text inline edit fields and save

3\) Using the mouse, click on the inline edit field

Notice that it doesn't immediately open, but just has an empty text field focused. Clicking on this or the inline edit field again, will bring it up into edit mode.
