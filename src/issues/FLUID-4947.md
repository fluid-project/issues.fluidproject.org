It has  play/pause and stop button, and a separated section as a header, indicating that it could be dragged. \\\nIf user presses play, text to speech will automatically start reading the content of the page, which could be tabbed through. The user could also highlight something (a paragraph) and press Play. By pressing Pause, text to speech will stop and stay where it was paused. But pressing Stop will jump to the beginning of the selected paragraph or page. &#x20;\n"
