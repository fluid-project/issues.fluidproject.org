We disable the play button when there are no steps, but the delete button is still enabled.  It seems more appropriate to disable the delete button when there’s nothing to delete.

 

Sepi agreed that we should do this, and as Daniel confirmed, it’s just a matter of updating the logic for the disabled property for the icon.
