When demands block contains the mergePaths policy for merging component options with demands options further component creation will not handle the resulting options argument to the creator function correctly.

Sample demands block:&#x20;

fluid.demands("uploader", "cspace.recordEditor", \["{recordEditor}.dom.uploader", {\
mergePaths: \["{options}", {\
model: "{recordEditor}.model",\
applier: "{recordEditor}.options.applier"\
}]\
}]);

as a result "{options}" will end up in that.options.value... instead of the correct that.options
