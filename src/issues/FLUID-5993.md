Conditional adjusters examples at <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/conditionalAdjusters/> and <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/conditionalAdjusters-singlePanel/> throws the error "ASSERTION FAILED:  Instantiation of view component with type fluid.textfieldSlider failed, since selector " .mpe-slider " did not match any markup in the document"

This may represent a regression to previous issues with conditional adjusters, the HTML5 range inputs and jQuery's context when dealing with the preferences in a frame, or it may be another issue. All the automated tests continue to pass, including the ones that were written against issues with conditional adjusters previously.
