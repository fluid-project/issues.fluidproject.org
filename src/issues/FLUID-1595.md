long file names in the upload queue, stretch the file queue

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader example&#x20;

2\) Add a file with a long name, such as "this\_file\_has\_a\_very\_long\_file\_name\_that\_should\_be\_displayed\_properly\_in\_the \_uploaders\_upload\_queue"

Notice that file queue's width expands to fit part of the name and wraps the rest to a new line
