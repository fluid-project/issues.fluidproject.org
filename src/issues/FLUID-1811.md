As a result, focus is not captured within the dialog, and in fact moves directly behind the dialog.\n\n2\\. There are no ARIA roles or states that would inform an AT user that this is an actual dialog.\n\nWe're not going to have a chance to implement fixes to these accessibility blockers before code freeze, so I've moved the code into a branch and removed the feature from trunk in preparation for the 1.1 release.&#x20;\n"

In Uploader, browse for a file that is larger than the 20MB limit, and click OK

Notice: that when the dialog dismisses that there is no message that the file was not added to your file queue.

Fix will need to account for both files that fail because of file size, type, or queue limit.
