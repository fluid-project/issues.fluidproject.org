FluidIoC tests fail sporadically when part of [all-tests.html](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/all-tests.html). When run individually ([here](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/core/html/FluidIoC-test.html) and [here](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/core/html/FluidIoCStandalone-test.html)), they always work.
