On one run I got the following failure when checking for the panel visibility. I don't suggest we devote much effort to fixing it right now since it is pretty hard to trigger the error (it might occur one time in 10 on heavily loaded hardware) but logging this just in case it comes up again. Also if we have some spare time we could "eyeball" the code to see if we can spot an obvious race condition. What's rather odd is that the asserted value is a floating point value than a boolean.

```java
