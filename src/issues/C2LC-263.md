As part of C2LC-234, we disabled the rendering tests in App.test.js, which failed because JSDom lacks mocks for the parts of the WebAudio API used by Tone.js.

As we did previously with BlueTooth and Speech Recognition, we can work around this by detecting whether the WebAudio API is available and choosing whether to instantiate the Samplers, Players, et cetera provided by Tone.js.
