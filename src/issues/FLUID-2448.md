No keyboard focus styling on page links

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Sakai Site Setting example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/pager-site-setting.html>

2\) Tap the 'tab' key to place focus on one of the page links

Notice that there is no visual styling to show you that focus has been placed on a page link
