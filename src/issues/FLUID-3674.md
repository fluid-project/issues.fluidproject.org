The "model semantic" requires that the precise model object reference keeps its identity - this has traditionally only been applied to the "model root" - but when "subappliers" are created, responsible for smaller parts of models, it needs to be ensured that the section of model they are bound to cannot be "cast adrift" by application of a change request that attempts to rebind their root reference from the point of view of its embedding in a larger model. This requires a "Cautious ChangeApplier" that preserves existing trunk references where possible, with a workflow somewhat similar to the current options merging system.
