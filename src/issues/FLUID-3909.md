After some investigation, the problem seems to come from the options within fluid.tooltip().  More precisely, the following option seems to be the problem:\n\ncontent: function () {\\\nreturn \"Tooltip\";\\\n},\n\nWhen \"title\" is not defined in an element and the above option is specified, then a \"mouseover\" event will add a \"title\" attribute to the element, but does not remove the attribute on \"mouseout\". &#x20;\n"

If no previous edits have been performed (i.e. if viewing a rich text editable field for the first time), entering Edit mode, and Cancelling renders the "Undo Edit" link.

To reproduce:

1\. Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/demo.html>\
2\. Press Edit link.\
3\. Press Cancel.

Notice Undo edit link even though no edits were performed.
