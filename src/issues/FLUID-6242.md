In preparation for [GPII-2444](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2444), Antranig Basman and I have discussed moving the message resolver out of the renderer.  We initially discussed moving this to Fluid.js, but as the grade requires FluidIoC.js to operate, we moved it to a new file instead.  Anything using the renderer will now need to require the new core MessageResolver.js file.
