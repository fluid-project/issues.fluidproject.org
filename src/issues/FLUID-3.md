In that case we would need to localise **all** the content, including the image fruit labels... ðŸ˜›\n"

When Lightbox is served up by the Gallery Tool in Sakai, localizable text is provided by the server using .properties files. When running stand-alone there is no such server. Therefore, the stand-alone HTML file (currently Lightbox.html) should be able to provide the localized text without a server being run.

A solution is to hard-code the strings into the Lightbox component.
