A feature that adds a random outcome to a sequence built by the student (e.g. code go mouse has a random action button, once pressed the mouse performs a random action like blinking or making a sound)

 

Details from co-design:

(Joseph) The key is to have the robot do something surprising or in an unexpected way. The unexpected outcome does not have to be visual. Could be auditory as well -- music that goes in an odd direction. (Lisa) Could there be a random behaviour that the robot could perform (that coders could learn from, or that could build on tasks that are programmed?). Thinking three modes: random behaviours on, random behaviour performed on request, or random turned off entirely)&#x20;

 

Possible options: 1. Low-fi design experiments (role playing)
