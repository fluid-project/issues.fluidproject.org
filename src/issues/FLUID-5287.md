The conditional transform "fluid.transforms.condition" has "true" and "false" options where a string or a nested transform are declared.

If only one of these true/false options has a nested transform declared while the other option has a string value, the conditional transformation outputs a correct result.

However, in the case that both options have nested transforms declared, the wrong result is given.
