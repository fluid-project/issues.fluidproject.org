Create a page in the Infusion API docs which will serve as a landing page (i.e. a destination) for project website links.&#x20;

For example, on page 5 of the Fluid Project website mockup, there is a link to "API". This link will reference this landing page in the API docs. \
See: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/327842/FluidProject-WebsiteMockup.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1401984558871&api=v2>

Until there are Framework API docs, this landing page will have only Component API references.
