Our exception decoding code in FluidDebugging.js is more than 10 years old and includes branches for numerous defunct browsers - in addition to, as with FLUID-6482, not coping with modern browsers like Safari - we should take the opportunity to strip it back, as well as not actually throwing the exception which is not necessary any more, and is a debugging hazard
