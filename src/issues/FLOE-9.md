      "body": "I've tested this on the new 'a11y-uio' branch that's based on Master. There are still a few things I've found that are not responding to the font size setting:\n\n* \"View all tags\" on front page\n* some drop-downs (including on the Advanced Search page, see <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-16#icft=FLOE-16>)\n* search buttons on advanced search page (see <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-16#icft=FLOE-16>)\n\nSince <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-16#icft=FLOE-16> exists, we should probably carry out the work on that page under that JIRA. I'll also create a separate JIRA for the 'view item' page, since that seems to be a big issue.\n"
