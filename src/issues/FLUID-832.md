      "body": "In Safari, simulate()'s call to document.createEvent(\"KeyEvents\") (jquery.simulate.js line 81) causes a \"NOT\\_SUPPORTED\\_ERR: DOM Exception 9\" exception. It falls through to the catch clause, which tries document.createEvent(\"Events\") (line 86).\n\nThe result of this is that the which field of the resulting event is not set in Safari.\n\nThe keyboard a11y plugin looks at the which field to decide whether or not to fire the activation handler (jquery.keyboard-a11y.js line 175), and since it's not set, it doesn't fire it. This is why the event simulation is not working properly.\n\nOne possible solution might be to modify the keyboard-a11y plugin to double-check the which field, and if it's not there, fall back to the keyCode or charCode.\n"
