Sketching a path using eye gaze.

 

Email from Susie: “Software that has been specifically designed to work with eye gaze technology have parameters built in to make it easier to select items (i.e. like a "snap to" element when close to an object and forgiveness for tremor, for leaving and reappearing over an object, etc.)”

How might we facilitate a student using an eye gaze AAC board?

* Separate device
* Hook into AAC software
* Note from Susie: This is the same dilemma regardless of what application a student is using to access curriculum. A third alternative (not as good) is to use a low tech version (no voice) while engaged in the coding application.
