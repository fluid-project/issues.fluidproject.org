Hey,

When you basically run 'grunt' (which takes the target all) the demos and examples in the build folder created in the process do not work as their linked dependencies (the script tags) are pointing to empty locations as there a clean task performed at the end of the build task.

However in the zip file created in the products folder, this is not the case as the files are cleaned post compression.

I have found a quick fix for this issue that is to remove the 'clean:postBuild' task from the build task, which is post compression and will make a Pull Request as soon as someone verifies it is an issue and is not intended for whatsoever reason.
