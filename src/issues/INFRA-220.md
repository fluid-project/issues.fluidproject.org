The free botbot.me IRC logging service is shutting down in November: <https://lincolnloop.com/blog/saying-goodbye-botbotme/>

We need to explore our options for logging IRC before this time. One is to run our own version of botbot, as it is an open source project:Â <https://botbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
