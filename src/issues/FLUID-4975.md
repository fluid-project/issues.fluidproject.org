Remove the css/ie8.css file from UI Options and replace with graceful degradation css, via a css support checker like modernizr.

Implemented here: <https://github.com/heidiv/infusion/tree/FLUID-4970-modernizr>

But issue with false-positive in IE8 for generatedcontent, seems to be because it's within an iframe that is initially hidden (has height of 0). Might be an issue with modernizr's check for this.
