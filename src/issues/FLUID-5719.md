It looks like our rich text editor links are failing. Testing tests/manual-tests/components/inlineEdit/rich/, I got the following errors:

"NetworkError: 404 Not Found - <http://tinymce-fluid.appspot.com/3.4.9/tiny_mce_src.js>"\
"NetworkError: 404 Not Found - <http://ckeditor-fluid.appspot.com/ckeditor.js>"

and
