Right now it is possible to specify "EL right hand" merge policies as currently seen in the Reorderer like so:

mergePolicy: {\
keysets: "replace",\
"selectors.labelSource": "selectors.grabHandle",\
"selectors.selectables": "selectors.movables",\
"selectors.dropTargets": "selectors.movables"\
},

the implementation in Fluid.js has a number of problems, for a start, that it has not been updated to consider that the new "policy-based" merge policies are not EL names (Fluid.js line 1231)\
if (typeof (elrh) === "string" && elrh !== "replace" && elrh !== "preserve") {\
however, the need to maintain these names in step with the actual implementation only show the fragility of this mechanism which could never be perfectly sure that a policy name actually represents a policy rather than an EL path. We expect this facility to be completely reimplemented as part of the <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4392#icft=FLUID-4392> work, but in the meantime we should at least deal with this glaring bug.
