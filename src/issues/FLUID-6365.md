These old-fashioned constructs suffer from very poor method combination capabilities as well as making unnecessary complexities for those who need to traffic in asynchronous values. We need a new, unifying construct, which arguably takes the form of a "very lightweight component" since it forms a scoping unit in which names can be resolved.

The old definitions would be "compiled" into the new form, much in the way that C's "structs" were grandfathered into C++ syntax as resugared kinds of "classes".

We codename this facility as "gyres" since the construct forms a small "swirl" in which names and values may locally follow each other about, until it is destroyed. We face the usual odd issue about when indeed we deallocate this thing - in the case it "compiles" to the effect of an old-fashioned method or invoker, we would obviously not allocate anything at all. In the case of a longer-lived gyre, it would be deallocated at the point that the lightweight IoC-like environment had made its last reference into it as a result of its final sequence step.

This development has been discussed and motivated atÂ <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Plan+to+Abolish+Invokers+and+Events>
