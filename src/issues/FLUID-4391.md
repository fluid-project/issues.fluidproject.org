\[12:54] \<harriswong> Justin\_o: i have a question on the imageReorderer.  I keep getting a " ASSERTION FAILED:  Listener registered for event afterMove which is not defined for this component" and i am not sure what i am missing.\
\[12:56] \<Justin\_o> harriswong: sounds like you have a listener that doesn't exist.. like if you passed in options like the following\
\[12:56] \<harriswong> Justin\_o: Looking at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Image+Reorderer+API>, listeners; i tried adding the "afterMove" to the listener in the demo (webapp/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/js/imageReorderer.js)\
\[12:56] \<Justin\_o> listeners: {someEvent: someUndefinedFunction};\
\[12:57] \<harriswong> Justin\_o: that's what i thought, i must be missing something somewhere, here is my code if you have a min, <http://pastebin.com/CcpeLJJH>\
\[12:58] \<Justin\_o> harriswong: what happens if you don't include the listener block at all?\
\[12:58] \<harriswong> Justin\_o: then it's fine, the current demo has no listeners.\
\[12:59] \<Justin\_o> harriswong: but you get the error with this?

This was caused by a framework fix that prohibited adding listeners to non-existent events, as well as the non-standard "wrapper" strategy for this initialise which creates a "fake component".
