Currently there is the awkward asymmetry between changes which are applied at the root and those applied elsewhere. Also the \"careful change applier\" needs to be implemented - but the more I think about it, the more there might be some subtleties in its implementation. What happens with arrays, for example.\n"

Crucial functionality is the ability to collect a sequence of incoming change events, and pen them up in a "transactional world". The holder of the "transaction" sees a private copy of the model with changes applied one-for-one, but external observers of the model do not see any changes until the transaction is "committed". As well as the ability to rollback a complex series of changes that have resulted in a constraint violation or been cancelled, this is also a form of API that is broadly useful when considering models which are from time to time committed to a server - it's appropriate for several changes to be collected on the client and then committed in a single bulk operation to the client. This will be immediately useful for CollectionSpace as well as being a crucial part of the implementation of the "new pager".
