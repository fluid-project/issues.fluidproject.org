Jutta would like to update the definition of Inclusive Design in the right sidebar of the About page:\
<http://inclusivedesign.ca/about/>\
to use the 'three dimensions' text we have on the IDRC site:\
<http://idrc.ocad.ca/>

specifically:

The Inclusive Design Research Centre and the MDes in Inclusive Design are working to better define and update what is meant by “Inclusive Design”. This is more challenging than you think as the practice has flexibility and adaptation at its core. Any criteria, principles or guidelines cannot be absolute but need to be relative to the user, the context, and the goal. We have even considered creating an inclusively designed definition that is presented in a flexible way depending on your particular perspective.  We have landed on three dimensions that best explain the practice and principles of inclusive design.
