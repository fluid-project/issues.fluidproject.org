When we changed the paths for Fluid 1.0, the head tags for our automated tests were reorganized. Unfortunately in an attempt to group the jqUnit files together the declaration: \<link rel="Stylesheet" media="screen" href="../../../lib/qunit/css/testsuite.css" />

ended up after some of the script declarations which is generally considered a no-no, although the incidence of things failing because of this are few and far between.&#x20;
