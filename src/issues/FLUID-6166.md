fluid.prefs.panel.contrast provides a custom radio button interface for an adjuster panel. It is specific for handling contrast themes, but should have the common portions factored out into a reusable grade. For work on UIO+ we need to make a similar adjuster for selection highlight and would benefit from having a base grade to build from.
