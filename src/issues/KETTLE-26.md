We need to improve Kettle's error handling pathways to interpret the object sent as argument to the onError request as a source for different status codes, e.g. 401 representing an unauthorized request. Right now it is hard-wired to always send the 500 status code. This is required for work on the OAuth2-secured cloud-based flow manager.
