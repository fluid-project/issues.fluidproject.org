The VP minification scripts bundle Infusion into the videoPlayer-all-min.js file. When the VP is integrated with UIO, the fat panel needs a copy of Infusion, loaded separately from whatever Infusion is on the rest of the page. When the minified file is used, that would mean that the fat panel would be loading the full videoPlayer-all-min.js file, which includes a lot that UIO doesn't need.\
The build scripts could be modified to also produce a minified version of just the Infusion file, for use by UIO, but this introduces some assumptions of UIO integration into the VP repository. This is not really horrible, but it does raise the suspicion that perhaps we should revisit this whole issue, and see if there's a better way.
