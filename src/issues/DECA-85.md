Decapod needs to be easily testable. For this purpose the following needs to be done:

1\. Implement a mock server that does not require cameras or work with gPhoto. It should always pretend there are two cameras attached to the system and should return images from the local file system.\
2\. Split Capture into several components - one handling the general workflow and others for each use case specific tasks (e.g. book liberator crop & stitch, stereo dewarping)\
3\. Provide mock test components that do nothing and return some test images instead.

Other items may be added to the list if needed.
