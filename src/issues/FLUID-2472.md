Text inside a combobox does not resize the same as the rest of the text

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the UI Options example or the Sakai mock-up example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uiOptions/html/UIOptions.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/ui-options-fss-sakai.html>

2\) Change the font size to the maximum or minimum size

Notice that text inside the comboboxes do not scale with the rest of text on the page
