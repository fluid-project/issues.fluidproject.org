The Layout Customizer and Lightbox are considered components in their own right. Right now, the sample code for these components is lumped under the 'reorderer' folder with other Reorderer sample code (other components get their own folder). Separating these samples out into their own folder might make it easier for developers to find samples for the component they're interested in.
