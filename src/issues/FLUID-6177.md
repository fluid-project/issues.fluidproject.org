Based on designs ( <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+UI+Options+Design+Walkthrough%2C+C.1?preview=/32014373/34734325/uio_tts2.jpg> ).

 

When self voicing is enabled, a user should be able to select some text to be self voiced. A play button should appear over the selected text, which can be clicked on to self voice the selection.
