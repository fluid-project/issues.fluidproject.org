At the moment, the Screen Navigator requires that content displayed in it implements a particular JavaScript contract with the ScreenNavigator in order for it to work. This coupling means that all content displayed in ScreenNavigator must be modified to support its use. Let's invert the dependency so that content can be used as-is.

As understand it, we'll need a way to delay execution of inline script block until they've been suitably manipulated by the Screen Navigator.
