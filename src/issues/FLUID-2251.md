Nothing seems to have focus after stopping an upload

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the server version of uploader\
<http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>

2\) Add several files to the file queue

3\) Start uploading the files

4\) Using the keyboard, tap the 'enter' key while the "Stop Upload" button has focus&#x20;

Notice that the uploads stop, but nothing seems to be focused. Tapping 'enter' on the keyboard doesn't seem to have any affect.&#x20;
