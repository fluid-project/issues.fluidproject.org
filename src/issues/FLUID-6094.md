When Infusion 2.0 is officially announced we should ensure that a news item is posted and that the featured work page is updated.&#x20;

Can replace the "Feedback Demo" with "Infusion" pointing to the website's infusion page. Should also consider adding a box for the First Discovery Tool, and Chart Authoring; probably replacing metadata and video player.
