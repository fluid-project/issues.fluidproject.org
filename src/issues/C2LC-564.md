Many descriptions include a leading “a” or “the”, but some (like “Eiffel Tower”, “Great Pyramid of Giza” don’t).  The examples with the leading articles make complete sentences and sound more natural (IMO).

Some places like “Machu Picchu” do not require a leading article, but “Great Pyramid”, “Great Sphinx”, “Tokyo Tower”, “Eiffel Tower” etc all seem like they’d benefit from adding a leading article.
