Details:

* Add remaining time (this is an estimate) to progress bar.
* Display format:  "16:45 remaining"&#x20;
* This is meant as a heuristic for users not an exact measurement.  The estimate may change depending on various factors. We want them to know "do I have time to grab a cup of coffee" or "I need to leave in 5 minutes, will this be done or should cancel and do it later or wait 1 extra minute cause its almost done"
