With Safari and Chrome, the test hangs once the first set of the tests completes with success.

With IE, error "Permission denied" at jQuery.js line 3889 is prompted before and after the first test gets run. Once the first set of the tests completes with success, it hangs.

With ff, all tests pass successfully.
