You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\\\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\\\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\\\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\\\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\\\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\\\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\\\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\\\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\\\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\\\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\\\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\\\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\\\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\\\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\\\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\\\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\\\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\\\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\\\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\\\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\\\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\\\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\\\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\\\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\\\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\\\nthe scope of this License.\"\n"
