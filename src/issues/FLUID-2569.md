Since the Stop Upload doesn't happen immediately (completes the upload of current file) this is VERY important feedback.  Otherwise, the user will likely hit stop upload many times trying to get it to do what they've asked.  I wonder if we might also want to add a message letting them know it will stop after completing the current upload.  During testing today I had this happen and thought it was broken until brain kicked into gear and I remembered it wouldn't stop until after uploading the current file which took several seconds.
