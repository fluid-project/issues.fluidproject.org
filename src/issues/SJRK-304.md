If the newly-added block is then removed, both the instructions **and** the editing area are hidden. Re-inspecting the instruction element at this point will then make it show once more. This leads me to believe it may be a bug within Edge, or some special circumstances that must be met before repainting occurs.\n"

The instructional message on the editor does not disappear in MS Edge after adding a block to the story. This is likely a lack of support for or problem with the specific CSS and JS used to hide the instructions and show the editing area with the new block.

**To reproduce**: Add a new block

**Expected**: The instructions disappear and the new block is visible

**Actual**: The new block in the editing area is shown, but the instructions are not hidden and show up beneath the editing area
