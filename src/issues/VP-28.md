On line 111 of VideoPlayer.js, we bind an activate handler to the main video, which plays/pauses the video. However, the controller's play/pause button doesn't get updated accordingly.

We should create Infusion events for playing and pausing, or bind to the HTML 5 video element's play and pause events so that the entire system stays in sync.
