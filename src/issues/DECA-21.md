If some directories do not have proper permission to write files, the scripts we run via command line may terminate abnormally.\
Currently, directory checks are being done inside take\_picture - this should move to a different part of the workflow.

One logical location to place directory checks is when a new book is created. When a book is created, we generate all the necessary directories and set the proper permissions.
