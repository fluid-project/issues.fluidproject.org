Image Reorder does not tell user when image has focus, is being moved, or its finallocation. Recommend that screen reader announce the following:

When control pressed: "Dragonfruit has focus. Use arrow keys to move."\
Each time arrow key pressed: "Dragonfruit moves right/left/up/down."\
When user presses control + alt + Num 5: "7 column by 2 row display. Dragonfruit in top row, third from left."
