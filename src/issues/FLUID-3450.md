The errors are as follows:

File does not exist: /home/continuum/website/docs/infusionBuilder/tests/infusion, referer: <http://forge.fluidproject.org/infusionBuilder/tests/html/InfusionBuilder-tests.html>\
File does not exist: /home/continuum/website/docs/infusionBuilder/tests/css, referer: <http://forge.fluidproject.org/infusionBuilder/tests/html/InfusionBuilder-tests.html>

To test this further, I added a directory under tests called css and then checked the error logs again. The files that were not found were the css files referred to in html/InfusionBuilder.html. This implies errors were cause by links in the header of the "fetched template" - even though the html template that was fetched did not encompass the header section.&#x20;

It may be worth exploring this further with other components that use fetchTemplate.

The advantage of fixing this problem is to cut down on errors in the apache error logs so that we can track down real problems.
