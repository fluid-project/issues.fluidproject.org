Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Image Reorder demo page\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/standalone-demos/reorderer/html/image-reorderer.html>

2\) Select one of the images that is partially covered by the instruction text. Notice that the border around the image goes on top of the instruction text.
