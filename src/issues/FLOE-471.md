I've created a new Fluid Project repo at <https://github.com/fluid-project/myl3> to hold MyL3-related code.

Some of the code in my prototype repo at <https://github.com/waharnum/learningDashboard/tree/FLOE-455> is in a state to be moved there after review, specifically the grades dealing with persistence and time-tracking.

I'm going to do the following:

* carve off a branch of the prototype repo that only has those grades and their dependencies
* transfer that code to my fork of the My3L repo
* submit a PR for it so it can be reviewed
