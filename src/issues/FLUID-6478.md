Many core framework utilities consuming JSON structures, such as fluid.copy and options merging in general, have a configurable maximum recursion depth, via the parameterÂ fluid.strategyRecursionBailout, which is helpful in providing a readable framework diagnostic rather than memory exhaustion or some other bare JS failure. We should extend this behaviour to the commonly used utility fluid.freezeRecursive also.
