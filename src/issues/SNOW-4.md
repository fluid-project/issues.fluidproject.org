So instead of h1.entry-title, maybe something like:\\\n.a11y-theme .ally-site-main-container .ally-site-main h1.entry-title\n\nThe more specific the CSS rule, the higher the precedence. This can help avoid the use of !important.\"\n\nAnd maybe set box-shadow to a grey line to the side so we don't need to do a z-index or move the aside after the main.\n"
