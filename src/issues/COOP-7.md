There are a number of promising technologies available to support platform cooperatives (Sharetribe, Loomio, etc), and some existing cooperatives have released their platforms as open source software (Loconomics, CoopCycle, etc.).

A technical analysis of these tools, along with some consideration of the APIs or integration work that would be needed to connect parts of them together (either as the basis for the toolkit's software or as temporary "scaffolding" to bootstrap other parts of the system) will help us determine which tools to use and in which ways.
