We would add support for deeper references by providing a mechanism to \"flatten\" a deeper structure in to an object with only top-level elements, keyed by EL Path, as in:\n\n```java\nmy.magic.converter({ deep:{  path: \"some text\" } })  // becomes { \"deep.path\": \"some text\" }\n```\n\nWith this structure, \"%deep.path\" would work as expected.  This should minimally impact existing users, as they in essence are already only able to refer to single-segment EL paths within their templates.\n"

Unless you have new thoughts on the subject, I would follow the approach outlined in the comments above, i.e.:\n\n1. Before iterating through keys in the values supplied to fluid.stringTemplate, the structure would be \"flattened\" as described above.\n2. The rest of the logic would be as before, iterate through the keys in the flattened object in reverse order by length, attempting to replace the longest key possible after the percent sign.&#x20;\n"

      "body": "@@Gregor Moss, the underlying concept of an EL Path does not support this type of \"go up to the parent, then down\" mechanism directly.  However, depending on your context, there may be other options.  For example, in my related i18n work with Handlebars templates, there is always the option to pass a different part of the current context to the handlebars helper, so that although you can only represent \"downward-facing\" material from your currently location using EL Paths, you can choose to start a particular evaluation higher in the context.  Handlebars provides the ability to pass in material relative to where you are, so in that environment you can indeed tree up, then down, you just have to do part of it with Handlebars.\n\nAnyway, if you can give a concrete example, I might be able to advise you further.\n\ncc: @@Antranig Basman\n"

Currently, `fluid.stringTemplate` only supports a single top-level key within the terms object, as in:

```java
fluid.stringTemplate("%foo.bar", { foo: { bar: "baz" }}); // returns "[object Object].bar"
```

In part to help with [variable handling in i18n message bundles](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2444), I would like to improve upon this by:

1. Looking for all valid [EL path](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/FrameworkConcepts.html#el-paths) characters to the right of each percent sign.
2. Breaking those down into segments by period characters.
3. Iterate through using the segments as input to fluid.get, lopping off the trailing segment until a match is found (or not).

This would allow deep referencing of material, such that:

```java
fluid.stringTemplate("%foo.bar", { foo: { bar: "baz" }}); // returns "baz"
```
