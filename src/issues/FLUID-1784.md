When in edit mode, the text field becomes smaller than the length of the text in display mode

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open either the sakai announcements or bSpace examples from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Edit one of the editable text fields. (e.g. replace text with "Change 1")

3\) Save the change

4\) Reopen in edit mode, Notice that it is not fully displayed in edit mode and that the text field is shorter in length than the text was in display mode
