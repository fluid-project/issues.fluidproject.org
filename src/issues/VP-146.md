Since IE is so hostile to unknown elements such as \<video>, we currently replace the user-supplied video tag (if it's there) with a plain old \<div>. However, the current implementation just deletes the element and everything inside it. The user could have legitimately included their own graceful degradation markup in there, which end up toasting in the process.
