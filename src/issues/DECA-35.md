Steps to recreate:

1\. Start up the decapod server without the cameras attached\
2\. Click 'take picture' - the camera detection dialog should appear\
3\. Connect the cameras and select continue

Pictures should be taken but they are not. Clicking take picture a second time will take pictures.&#x20;
