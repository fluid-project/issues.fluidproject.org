However it was possible to construct a test case for this issue since finding them on the way down will trigger a circularity failure since they are not yet properly attached to the tree and so fail during ginger construction.\n"

Although this name could be discovered by inspecting either the instantiator or the next supercomponent, visitComponents always supplies a member name of "" for every component on the direct path to root as a result of the line&#x20;
