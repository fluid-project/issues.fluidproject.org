I did a few other changes. 1) I added the highlighting to all inputs as well 2) for the comments page, I added the highlighting to the textarea 3) on the code entry page i changed the buttons from images to inputs with type=\"image\"\n"

Buttons, list items, etc. should highlight to a colour (say, blue) to indicate that the user successfully tapped on a particular item. See <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Mobile+wireframes%2C+draft+9#Mobilewireframes%2Cdraft9-Guidelines...fortappingonatappable>
