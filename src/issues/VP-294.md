VideoPlayer should have some indicators in the UI to notify the user that VideoPlayer is fetching available languages from the caption service (e.g. Amara)

The should be a way to show that VideoPlayer is partially ready and that menus will be populated with languages beyond those which were specified by an integrator.

Designer should provide more information on what those indicators should be or how VideoPlayer should carry this message to the user.
