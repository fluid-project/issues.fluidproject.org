Using NVDA in FF, every focusable text block in the transcript pane says "Text Frame" which does not seem helpful. I am not sure what the proper behaviour should be - perhaps some investigation is required.

To reproduce:

* Launch NVDA
* In Firefox Launch <http://build.fluidproject.org/videodemo/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Show the transcripts
* Tab to the transcript text area
* Enter NVDA browse mode (INS+Enter or NVDA+Enter)
* Arrow down a few times
* Note: each time a new block is focused, the screen reader says "Text frame".
* To each the contents press NVDA + Down Arrow (INS + Down Arrow)
