In speaking with Antranig in the fluid-work channel ( <https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2014-10-02/?tz=America/Toronto> ) it was determined that the improvements for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-227#icft=FLOE-227> should be made in FluidRequests.js. Additionally will need to have a queue for set and delete as well as a queue for get. Also need a top level option to enable amalgamation or requests where new requests replace a queued one. Will create an empty datasource that only includes comments about how a typical datasource should be constructed.

See comments from <https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/43>
