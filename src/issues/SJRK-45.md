Reorganize the grades in the Storytelling Tool UI to have a more clearly readable grade structure, utilizing composition ("has-a") over inheritance/merging ("is-a").

The proposed structure would include a "UI Manager" grade which will keep track of the UI language and StorySpeaker, and will have as components of it the various views, "UI" grades or similar. I.e. the Editor and Viewer/Previewer are UI's, and the UI Manager has one or more UI's.

Each UI will have a TemplateManager which will in turn have as components a template/resource loader and template renderer. Each UI will have a story, and can have a gpii.binder to link story values to the DOM.

See attached image for a diagram of this proposed layout.
