The ToggleButton component is not itself keyboard accessible: it is not activatable using the space or enter keys. In the VideoPlayer, the keyboard activation is added on by components that use the ToggleButton.

Would it not be more reasonable for the keyboard access to be built into the ToggleButton itself, in a way that was configurable by the component using it?
