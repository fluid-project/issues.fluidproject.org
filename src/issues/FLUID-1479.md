Moving an item in the lightbox causs formating issues. This happens in both the standalone version and as a nested reorderable in the uPortal example

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the lightbox example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/generic-lightbox/generic-lightbox.html>

2\) Move one of the images

3\) Notice that the formatting is improper. You may have to move the pointer off of the lightbox to see it.
