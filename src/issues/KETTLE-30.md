The current positioning of instantiated kettle request components makes it awkward to resolve expected material using IoC references. For example, in the GPII's OAuth-enabled cloud-based flow manager, a request handler definition looks as follows:

```java
handle: {
            funcName: "gpii.request.flowManager.onOauth2Settings",
            args: ["{request}", "{that}", "{gpii.flowManager.cloudBased.oauth2}.oauth2DataStore"],
            dynamic: true
        }
```

The resolution onto the "dataStore" is awkward, requiring it to be found via a member reference, whereas the author of the "app" into which this request is mounted would expect to be able to simply use the expression "{dataStore}" as elsewhere in the definition of the app.

This results from the current awkward positioning of request objects as descendents of a member "requests" held on the server, rather than the app - here are the paths of the relevant members of this hierarchy:

```java
"tests.configuration.server.flowManager.oauth2DataStore": { typeName: "gpii.oauth2.inMemoryDataStore"}

"tests.configuration.server.requests.request-5.handler": { typeName: "kettle.requests.request.handler"}
```

Since requests are descended at the level of "server" rather than "flowManager", descendents of flowManager cannot directly be identified. Of course, this problem would be eliminated naturally once we had a resolution for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5556#icft=FLUID-5556>.
