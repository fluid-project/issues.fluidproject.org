Based on the research under FLOE-187, FLOE-188, FLOE-189, begin creating an exemplar which demonstrates key inclusive principles for EPUB 3. This includes (but not limited to):

* alternatives to media and scripts
* good use of markup (HTML5, EPUB markup, PLS, SSML, aural style sheets)
* good use of metadata\
  etc.

The exemplar may be created from scratch, or adapted from an existing resource. If using an existing resource, we will need to ensure that the license permits remixing and redistribution.
