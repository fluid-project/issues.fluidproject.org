In the meantime, we'll maintain both styles to keep the tests passing.&#x20;\n\nThe defaults for inlineEdits are different than those for a single Inline Edit component. These defaults store selectors specific to the creation of a **set** of inline edits.\n\nI'm open to suggestions for how to handle this. In my mind, the fluid.defaults() is a central registry for the default settings for components. The decision on how defaults should be organized is based on ensuring a separation of concerns. In this particular example, InlineEdit represents a single instance of the component, while inlineEdits() is a set of them. Hence separate defaults.\n"

Currently, you have to instantiate each inline edit field on a page individually. It would be very helpful to have a single function that will create a whole set of them in one call. For example:

fluid.inlineEdits(containerId, options); // Returns an \[] of inline edit instances.
