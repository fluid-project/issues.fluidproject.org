You'll need to use the latest version of the Flocking core-refactoring branch, commit 55e7778ea4944644d48690bc1969cba8078a018c or later:\n\n<https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/tree/core-refactoring>\n\nAnd here is the latest version of the synths:\n\n<https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/b9a50fdabd04ba0f888e>\n\nYou'll notice that the durations of the sequences have changed, as have the MIDI note values. I made several mistakes there, so went back to Dana's sketch and was able to determine the correct timing and pitches. You'll need to, I'm sorry to say, update your model transformation accordingly.\n"

Colin Clark is working on a prototype basic data sonification component.

Once that is complete, we should be able to wire it into the larger chartAuthoring component in the usual IoC style.
