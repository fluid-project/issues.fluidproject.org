links and code are hard to edit

1\) Open the rich text inline edit

2\) cut and paste in a url (i.e. [http://build.fluidproject.org](http://build.fluidproject.org/))

3\) cut and paste in some code (i.e. \<a href="[http://build.fluidproject.org](http://build.fluidproject.org/)">build site\</a>)

Notice that it is difficult or impossible to re-open edit mode, and the url does not function as a link
