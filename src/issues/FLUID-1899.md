Currently when a user comes to the OSDPL, it is not clear what they can do, what kind of content is on the site, or what is happening.

Modifications should be done on the front page so that:

* A sense of community process is conveyed.
* Example content is readily available
* Give an opportunity right away to participate&#x20;

the front page should convey a few important details at a glance: examples of content on the site, evidence of activity and discussions taking place, and an obvious way to get involved.
