We should create a demonstration of internationalizing one or more of our components using best-practices, and create documentation (tutorial and/or other) around the topic. We should also double-check our existing demos to ensure that they embody our best-practices and could be easily converted to another language. Our documentation could even use existing demos, perhaps, and illustrate how to modify the demo to be in a different language.
