Use the information gathered in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-1215#icft=FLUID-1215> to design and implement a new front page for the OSDPL. Defining goals for the page should be a first step in this process. Information on this page about OSDPL goals may be helpful in formulating the goals for this page: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883725>

If we've defined governance policies and procedures for contributing patterns, it would also be helpful to add a pointer to content about how to do this (though I'm guessing the actual content should go on a separate page).
