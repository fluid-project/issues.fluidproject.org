Moving keyboard selection in the direction of an empty column causes portlet to lose focus. The focus should remain on the portlet.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Move all of the movable portlets below the locked portlet

3\) With one of the portlets having focus, press the arrow key in the direction of the empy column. Notice that focus is removed from the portlet
