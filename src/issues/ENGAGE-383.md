CouchDB appears to have a very strange bug. When using a composite key to a view, for example:

{\
key1: "foo",\
key2: "bar"\
}

You must ensure that the keys are listed in the same order as they were defined in the view, otherwise Couch will fail to match them. Since JavaScript objects don't specify a fixed order for keys (how could they?), this must be a bug in Couch itself.

If I were to speculate, perhaps Couch is comparing the stringified version of keys.
