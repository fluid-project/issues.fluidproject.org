Each program block in the actions menu is announced by VoiceOver as a toggle button.  VoiceOver instructs the user to toggle the button using VO+space.  Unlike simply holding space, for most toggles this announces the state change.  When using VO+space to select a command, “selected” is announced (as expected).  When using VO+space to deselect a command, no VoiceOver announcement results.  Our announcement does play, but this seems inconsistent with things like the toggles, which clearly announce both “off” and “on” when using VO+space.
