Add the "Storytelling safety & Etiquette" section to the bottom of the Story Builder. The text should read:

"**Storytelling safety & etiquette**

• Avoid identifying information such as names and addresses in your story.\
• Don’t publish photos or video of other people without their explicit consent.\
• Avoid content that threatens or intimidates any person or suggests violence, hatred or discrimination toward other people."

The background colour is #CBE2E1, please refer to the attached image for the visual design.
