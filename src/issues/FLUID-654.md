It would be great to include a file in the source code bundle that explains to developers how to find documentation for Fluid components.

I am thinking of a README.html file or perhaps Documentation.html that provids a quick list of pointers into the wiki for documentation. Something that we can include in the source bundle for developers. This might just be a simple export of the ToC page as HTML, or perhaps just a very brief explanation of where to go to find all of Fluid's documentation along with a URL.
