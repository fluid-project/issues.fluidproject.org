If you run `that.locate(selector)` from a view component that does not have a matching selector, currently the entire container is returned.  This means that a single typo in a selector can result in mistakenly operating on the entire container.  In talking with Antranig about working around this problem, he proposed simply fixing it in FluidView\.js.

```java
@bosmon, I hope you recall our "binder" that binds selectors to model values. the-t-in-rtf1 @ 2:57
I am looking at it again, it fails completely if the selector isn't valid. 2:57
if you recall, that.locate() with a bad selector returns the container. 2:58
rather than null. 2:58
I am wrapping the result in fluid.unwrap, which is undefined for selectors that don't exist and defined for selectors that are. 2:58
Is using fluid.unwrap a reasonable way to detect this? 2:59
in other words var element = that.locate(selector) 2:59
and then if (fluid.unwrap(element)) 2:59
as a test for validity. 2:59
@Bosmon ^^^^ 3:01

the-t-in-rtf1 - you may instead just want to patch the DOM binder Bosmon @ 3:35	
Bosmon
The correct behaviour for it should be to return a 0-element jQuery in the case the selector matches nothing Bosmon @ 3:35
We can patch this in a shortly upcoming infusion, this behaviour has annoyed us for far too long 3:36

I would be very gratified to have that be my first pull request against infusion. the-t-in-rtf1 @ 3:39

I would start with the tests, but just to confirm that I'm on the right track, I would need to change behavior round about here:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L170 the-t-in-rtf1 @ 3:47
