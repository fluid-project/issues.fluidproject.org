      "body": "Hi cindy - thanks for these reports! The test cases are not entirely valid, since i) the staticEnvironment is not a component, and so the \"member name\" for any entries there is not meaningful, and ii) only actual components can be resolved as context names - you can't just place arbitrary material in the staticEnvironment and have it resolvable as a context! In fact we will before long remove all manual access to the staticEnvironment in order to ensure that only valid material is placed there.&#x20;\n\nUntil then you will need to ensure that everything you want to resolve as a context is actually a component - I have reworked your test cases so that they demonstrate this style at <https://github.com/amb26/infusion/commit/64a7eef4bf10a478afeaea2cdc345583c7354677#L1R2846> - however the misleading message from the framework \"Malformed context reference\" is indeed a bug and this pull request includes a fix for that issue\n"

The two cases below are based on the condition of fetching the IoCSS source value from fluid.staticEnvironment.

Case 1:\
If the target pinpoints to a particular option regardless of whether this particular option is existing or not, nothing would be passed down.

The test case to demonstrate this issue: @ <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5010/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2804-2834>

Case 2:\
If the target is an existing options block, this error occurs at resolving the reference to the static environment variable: "Cannot parse context reference \\"{\\": Malformed context reference without }"

The test case to demonstrate this issue: @ <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5010/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2836-2865>
