Due: Wednesday, Oct 28, 09

* Review: the attached document from Jenifer, then review Jame's UI drawings (drawings to follow) and rethink our In-museum kiosk UI designs.&#x20;

- Draw: based on this new information draw (pencil on paper) some ideas for how the interface could change. James encourages to go WILD!!!&#x20;

* Design Review: Bring these drawings to work on Monday and be ready to have a design review - the goal will be to come up with 3 UI Drafts  to conduct a paper prototype test with.

- FE Design Review: Once we select the 3 UI designs - then we'll build them out in illustrator and present them to James - Wednesday!
