There should be an easy way to ignore elements in the markup to prevent it from appearing in the Table of Contents. For example, add a "flc-toc-tocContainer-ignore" class to elements and any headers contained within will be excluded.

Conversely, we may want to consider a way to explicitly include an element if its parent is excluded.
