When the client's browser is resized, the "Contact" link in the header would get pushed bellow the "About" link. Visually this doesn't look right because it looks like "Partners Contact".

Some ideas for a solution:

* put more of a vertical padding so links lay out more distinctly in this scenario
* maintain the row of links and push the entire link container below the UIO tab
