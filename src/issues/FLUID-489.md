On mousing over the reorderable portlets on the portlets-with-precedence test page\
( <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/abstract/portal/portlets.html> )\
the mouse pointer does not change style indicating the element is moveable (as required by the test procedures).
