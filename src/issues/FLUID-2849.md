Obvious solutions involve storing a state cookie that remembers the user's setting, or perhaps recommending that application developers persist this choice themselves in some way such as a query parameter.&#x20;\n\nThis issue also relates indirectly to the issue of allowing users to globally control avoidance of Flash (or complex UIs) via UI Options.\n"

When the Uploader is used in single-file mode: After a "save" the view switches automatically back to the multi-file version.

To reproduce:\
1\) <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/html/Uploader.html>\
or\
<http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>\
2\) Switch to "standard single-file Uploader"\
3\) Browse and select a single file\
4\) Click the "Save" button

The view automatically reverts to the multi-file interface.
