However, I do not believe that the existing tests cover all the flows that \"initialised\" guards.\n\nTo continue this work, I think the next step would be to understand the framework changes that have happened since the \"initialised\" was added to the Tooltip to see if it is actually still needed. And add unit tests as needed.\n\nI'll attach a diff on Tooltip.js that comments out usage of \"initialised\" and makes the small change to fluid.tooltip.setup as mentioned above.\n"

The tooltip component has several TODO's scattered throughout the codebase, as it was waiting on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-3674#icft=FLUID-3674> and FLUID-4890.

The TODO's should be addressed, now that those issues have been resolved in master. Any other modernization that can happen at this time should also be implemented.

* Currently the modelListener is setup to listen to changes on the entire model, but should listen separately to changes on "content" and "idToContent"
* remove the "initialised" member workflow and replace with a framework facility
* consider removing backwards compatibility code
