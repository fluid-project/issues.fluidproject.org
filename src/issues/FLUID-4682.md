Described in the documentation <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Tutorial+-+Layout+Reorderer+Selectors> and also in version 1.4 multi select works, but if you swap out jquery with the 1.7 version (latest), when dragging a widget aroudn the page the selector only selects the first column which means you can drop in to any other columns.
