JAWS reads: \"Astronomy 7 A P 001 LEC Button\"\n\n3\\. Press ENTER to enter Inline Edit field.  Note: this is an unintuitive action for a JAWS user: they assume the \"button\" is not editable. JAWS reads: \"Enter sections edit Astronomy 7 A P 001 LEC type in text\"\n\n4\\. Type in \"Hello\". Press ENTER to save. JAWS reads \"ENTER Astronomy 7 A P 001 LEC Button\". Note that the change made in Step 3 (\"Hello\") is not read, and that JAWS does not announce that a save has been made.&#x20;\n\n5\\. Refresh the JAWS virtual buffer (press INSERT-ESC). JAWS reads: \"Screen updated,\" but the change made in Step 3 is not read. Press TAB and the SHIFT-TAB to refocus onto the Inline Edit to get JAWS to read the changes made. JAWS reads: \"Shift tab hello button\".&#x20;\n\nIssues: \\\nInstructions needed:\\\n-how to enter the inline edit field\\\n-how to save an edit\n\nNotifications needed: \\\n-user should be notified of change is saved\\\n-user may need to know Virtual Buffer needs to be refreshed to see changes.&#x20;\n"

Embed a toggle button after the editable text--text no longer gets focused, but the toggle button does instead. Text is still given \"focused\" style. The toggle button element will need enough of a label to make sense to the user\n\nThe toggle button can be invisible. It will be actionable by the keyboard, and will place focus styling on the text when tabbed to. The text itself will be actionable by the mouse, but not the keyboard.&#x20;\n\n<http://old.nabble.com/accessibility-issues-to-think-about-to29522497.html>\n\nI believe we will try to code up both options and test with a user.\n"

A protocol for accessing and using the inline edit area must be made available to a JAWS user:&#x20;

* JAWS announces that an inline edit area is a button.&#x20;
* no indication about how to make or save an edit
* no indication that an edit is successful&#x20;
* the JAWS virtual buffer needs to be refreshed or the user will not be able to see the changes made.&#x20;

"Redo" "Undo" buttons also need to be accessible to a screen reader.&#x20;
