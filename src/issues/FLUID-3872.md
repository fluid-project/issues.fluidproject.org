When we introduced the HTML 5 version of the Uploader and IoC-ified its architecture, we temporarily disabled Uploader's progressive enhancement features. We would also like to deprecate the specialized progressivelyEnhanceableUploader() creator function, instead providing seamless progressive enhancement for all users via the IoC system.

In light of these changes, we should re-implement progressive enhancement so that we can degrade from HTML 5 to Flash to single file upload based on the capabilities of the user's browser and (optionally) specific overrides by the implementer.
