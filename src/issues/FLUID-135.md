The CSS files for Gallery (images.css) and Lightbox (Lightbox.css) load at the very top of the \<HEAD> tag for the iFrame before everything else. \
Issues:

* They both load before the tool.css and toolbase.css which means that they cannot override the style declarations in those files
* images.css loads before Lightbox.css which means that images.css cannot override the styles in Lightbox.css

\[Additionally the first thing that should load in a HEAD tag is a char-set declaration but that's not really pertinent to this bug.]
