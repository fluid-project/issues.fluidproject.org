Currently the preference framework makes use of message bundles and the messageResolver. In cases where the renderer is used, it is simple enough to use the message rendererer component to get at the values. However, if a component needs to use the string values outside of the message renderer component, expanders are needed to perform the appropriate lookup.

Example:

```java
// simple lookup function
fluid.slidingPanel.lookupMsg = function (messageResolver, value) {
    var looked = messageResolver.lookup([value]);
    return looked ? looked.template : looked;
};

// complex lookup function which returns an array of strings for a given group of messagekeys
fluid.prefs.panels.lookupMsg = function (messageResolver, prefix, values) {
    var messages = [];
    fluid.each(values, function (value, key) {
        var looked = messageResolver.lookup([prefix + "." + value]);
        messages.push(looked ? looked.template : looked);
    });
    return messages;
};
```

This process should be simplified through the use of resolvePathSegment, similar to how the dom binder works with calls to "{that}.dom.selector"

1\) Create an object to lookup the messages from the message resolver. and bound to the stringBundle member name.&#x20;

2\) the function should be able to look up keys and namespaces.&#x20;

Note this will only provide access to the string value via IoC.
