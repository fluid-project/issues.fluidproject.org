It is dificult to drag an item below the last movable element in a list. If any drop targets appear (anywhere but below the last movable element), the drop target does not appear below the last element and the item cannot be dropped there.&#x20;

Link to sites: <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/scheduler/RSFStyleScheduler.html>

NOTE: on the second site, this only true for the nested items. The top level elements can be dragged below the the last movable element.\
also, on this site <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/todo-list/sortable-todo-list.html>\
there are no issues. I'm not sure what the difference is.
