Running \`npm install\`Â with npm@5 generates the following warning:

```
npm WARN prepublish-on-install As of npm@5, `prepublish` scripts are deprecated.
npm WARN prepublish-on-install Use `prepare` for build steps and `prepublishOnly` for upload-only.
npm WARN prepublish-on-install See the deprecation note in `npm help scripts` for more information.
```

This is explained in \`npm help scripts\`:

```
PREPUBLISH AND PREPARE

   DEPRECATION NOTE

       Since , the npm CLI has run the prepublish script for both npm publish and npm install, because it's  a  convenient way  to  prepare  a  package  for use (some common use cases are described in the section below).  It has also turned out to be, in practice, [very confusing](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074).  As of, a new  event has been introduced, prepare, that preserves this existing behavior. A _new_ event, prepublishOnlyhas been added as a transitional strategy to allow users to avoid the confusing behavior of existing npm versions and only run on npm publish` (for instance, running the tests one last time to ensure they're in good shape).

       See https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074 for a much lengthier justification, with further reading, for this change.
