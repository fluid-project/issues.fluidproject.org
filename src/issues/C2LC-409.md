In C2LC-333, we added the ability to perform actions without clicking or navigating to controls.  This is a problem in particular for the actions panel, which does not close when hitting the play button. As a result, it's possible to delete a step from a running program, using the following steps.&#x20;

1. Create a longish program.
2. Navigate to a late step and open its action panel.
3. Focus on the delete icon.
4. Hit Alt+P to play the program.
5. Hit enter to delete the selected step.
