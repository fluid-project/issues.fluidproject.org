Steps to reproduce:

* Select an action
* Deselect the same action

 

Expected:

* The action remains focussed

 

Actual:

* The action isn’t focussed
* The hover style is applied

 

See: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/64553121> If we want to remove the hover styling, we might be able to do so with some media queries. However, the trick is to make sure you aren’t removing the hover styling when a mouse is also being used. Modern iOS and iPadOS devices, android, and touch enabled desktop/laptops would all support both touch and mouse interactions. 

 

From a quick visual inspection it looks like both the selected and :hover styling are being applied on the first tap. The second tap maintains the :hover styling and removes the selected styling.
