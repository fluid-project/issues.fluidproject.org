This will also be used by ATs\n* add status updates as a dialog\n  * can be cleared by the user\n  * Automatic removal options\n    * never, can only be removed by user\n    * after some time\n    * when a new update is received, it replaces the previous one\n    * replaced on update or removed after some time\n"

This could also include a block-type breakdown\n* have a notification panel that could also act as a history (if the notifications persist) - need to make sure the new notification is highlighted when added\n* use some kind of animation to show the block being added, that emerges from the button or from the top of the tool frame\n* active state for block buttons could be more prominent - a '+' sign or checkmark appears? (rather than or in addition to the button changing colour)\n* have a zoomed-out panel view of the story, showing thumbnails of all the blocks. This could scroll up as blocks are added beyond the bottom of the frame\n"

Provide user feedback when a block is added in a way that helps them find it, e.g. "Image block added below"
