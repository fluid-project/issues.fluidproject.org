Opening the ck editor causes a javascript error when the demo is loaded a second time in IE 6. Note that the error does not happen when looking at the demo through the demo portal.

Steps to Recreate:

1\. Load the rich text demo in IE 6 using this link: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/html/inlineEdit.html>\
2\. Open the ck editor by clicking on the edit link\
3\. Refresh the page\
4\. Open the ck editor again by clicking the edit link

The following error will appear:\
Line 7, Char 1: Object doesn't support this property or method
