When the source maps are generated they are provided with a [root](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/6fdd188bab89fff034e58a5c0bcdcdc9543010bd/buildModules.js#L345) option. The root is set to `"../"` which works for dist builds because they are in the "dist" directory and refer to files that are in the "src" directory. However with package builds (e.g. `npm run build:pkg`), the src directory is a direct sibling of the concatenated file. In this case root should be `""`.

Two potential solutions:

1. Copy src into dist, so that the root can always be `""`. 
2. Make the root option configurable through buildModules.js's api so that dist builds and package builds can specify a different root value.
