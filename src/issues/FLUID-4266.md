Currently UIOptions both contains all the dialog functionality as well as has several subcomponents. This can be factored better as Antranig points out in the following code review comment:

I would actually refactor this area quite significantly - uiOptions.preview should not be a subcomponent of uiOptions but actually a container/sibling of it. **OR** the thing currently called uiOptions should actually be renamed uiOptionsDialog - and this is the thing which has the link JUST to settingsStore and nothing else. Then the name "uiOptions" can be used for the "orchestrating component" which contains a preview, a uiOptionsDialog, a settingsStore and a uiEnhancer as direct children. Almost all the members which are currently on uiOptions (basically all the "controls") would go onto uiOptionsDialog.
