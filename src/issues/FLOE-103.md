The Insert Table dialog is very confusing using a screen reader.\
The dialog does not have proper announcement messages when user tabs through the possible table variations.\
Moreover there should be a way to use the dialog with keyboard arrows instead of Tab since Tabbing through the dialog could be pretty long and not very user-friendly.
