Enactors like Text Size, Line-Height, Letter-Spacing and etc that modify the styling of a page without necessarily adding a class, they should still add a class to identify that the enactor is enabled. This will provide a hook for an integrator to adjust the layout and presentation of the content to best work with the adjustment. It would be even better if specific classes for the various adjustment levels could be provided. (e.g. similar to how contrast works).
