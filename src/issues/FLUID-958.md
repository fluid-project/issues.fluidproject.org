In order to arrange more advanced cooperation between components and "component fragments" with regards render and model state, we need to draw up external contracts that participating components will enjoy. A particular and immediate example requirement is that of "undo" functionality - it should be possible to "decorate" an arbitrary component or selection of components with "undo-ability" at both a visual and functional level, part of which requirement is expressed by <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-780#icft=FLUID-780>, "undo for individual InlineEdit" component.

Important requirements are that i) the state ("model") of each component is isolable and enjoys "reasonable" semantics, and that ii) an overal "re-rendering" of each participating component can be triggered in a uniform way given updates to this state.
