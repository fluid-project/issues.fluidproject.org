The [current docs for jqUnit](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/jqUnit.html) point out that the module is based on version 1.x of QUnit, and makes reference to certain functions that no longer exist in the new API.

For example, the [documentation for jqUnit.asyncTest](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/jqUnit.html#jqunitasynctestname-testfunc) mentions that it is a "Direct passthrough for QUnit.asyncTest", with a link to the relevant QUnit function: <http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.asyncTest/>

The issue is that that URL then redirects to QUnit.test, as QUnit.asyncTest no longer exists in API 2.x: <https://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit/test>

Outside of updating the version of QUnit used by jqUnit (a whole other can of worms), I propose updating the text of the links with a mention that the old version of the API is no longer offered on QUnit's website, or perhaps linking to the Wayback Machine's archived version of that page: <https://web.archive.org/web/20160604092138/http://api.qunitjs.com:80/QUnit.asyncTest/>
