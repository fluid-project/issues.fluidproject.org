A "submodel" created through the expansion of EL material referring to a wider model (in this case, via renderer variables in an expander) becomes "detached" from the "supermodel" that it is created from - when really we need "writeback" of changes which are issued to the applier via autobinding to occur. This case is required by CSPACE-3905.
