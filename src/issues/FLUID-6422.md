The fluid.textNodeParser.hasTextToRead function attempts to see if text is hidden by checking the elements offsetHeight. However, if the element only contains floated elements, it will have an offsetHeight of 0, even if those child elements are visible. 

A more robust check for visibility needs to be done to determine if the text is actually visible.
