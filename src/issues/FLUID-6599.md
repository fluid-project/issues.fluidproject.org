Since the new implementation (in the <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6145#icft=FLUID-6145> etc.) branch defaults each element of a DataSource URL separately in the parsed structure, the inbuilt default port of 80 ends up being applied even if an https URL is supplied - in order to get the expected behaviour the user needs to explicitly supply port 443 in the URL or options, which is a usability failure.
