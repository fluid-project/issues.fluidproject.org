To allow for even more flexible markup, any element should be able to be used as triggers for actions, not just elements with an innerText attribute\
i.e. \<input type="button" name="x" value="x" /> should be valid

As per my conversation with Colin, this is due to changing the text of elements on the fly with .html()
