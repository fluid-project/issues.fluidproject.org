The merging/expanion pathway for the FLUID-4982 "ginger world" involves a complex network of mutually recursive functions forming the "flooding/driving" API pattern in which the arguments "segs" holding an array of path segments appears repeatedly. In a kind of "false economy" it appears we have tried to economise on the creation of this array more than is correct. When debugging a complex piece of the expansion workflow for instantiating the ModuleLayout configuration of the Reorderer, it seems that reentering the expansion workflow for the same component at a different path has corrupted the array of path segments.

In particular, an array which previously held \["selectors", "grabHandle"] was seen to be corrupted to \["selectables", "grabHandle"] before the previous path became completely merged.

This Reorderer configuration operates an extremely complex workflow which injects upwards three overrides for "selectables" members, from the "moduleLayout" up to the parent "reorderer" whilst it is still in the process of instantiating.. We should try to be less aggressive about sharing the "segs" array as well as trying to trace in detail the workflow responsible. This appears yet another case in which FLUID-4925 wave of explosions will be helpful - since it seems that the creation of the moduleLayout subcomponent is not necessarily triggered by a reliable process.
