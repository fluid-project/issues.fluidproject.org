While we're updating the site to mobile UIO + responsive layout, should also do the following:

1\) Update to the new Hewlett Foundation logo available at <http://bo2jfqbjeb-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/hewlett/dist/images/logo.svg>

2\) Make the logo and grant acknowledgement text function better at various responsive sizes
