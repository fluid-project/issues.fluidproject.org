In the case where one or more dots are presented in the original object paths, mergePolicy doesn't support the escaping of those dots. The example:

The variables of source objects to be merged. Note the dots in a path:

```java
var source1 = {
            a: {
                "b.c": [1, 2]
            }
        };

        var source2 = {
            a: {
                "b.c": [3, 4]
            }
        };
```

To escape the dots in the path, the merge policy is defined as:

```java
var mergePolicy = {
            "a.b\\.c": fluid.arrayConcatPolicy
        };
```

However, since the escaping in the mergePolicy is not yet supported, rather than returning this expected result:

```java
var expected = {
            a: {
                "b.c": [1, 2, 3, 4]
            }
        };
```

The path specified in the mergePolicy is ignored and the actual returned value is the variable of source2.
