Below is a section of component tree - in it, "title-plain" is a leaf node, but is presented with children, because its markup contains further nodes. This triggers the "erroneous branch", currently at line 1778 of the renderer:

if (component && component.children !== undefined) {\
renderContainer(component);\
renderindex = lump.close\_tag.lumpindex + 1;\
}

which can never execute correctly since it does not supply a target branch point. Behaviour in this case should be clarified and a reasonable diagnostic issued.

var fullTree = {\
children: \[\
// The colon (ðŸ™‚ at the end of the rsf ID identifies the component as a repeating\
// component. In this full tree, there is one object for each repeated component.\
{\
ID: "resource-item:",\
children: \[ {\
ID: "title-plain",\
decorators: \[\
{\
type: "addClass",\
classes: "level0"\
}\
],\
children: \[	{\
ID: "title-link",\
linktext: "My Workspace",\
target: "/user/jimeng/",\
decorators: \[{\
attrs: {title: "Folder"}\
}]

}, {\
ID: "title-image", \
target: "../images/dir\_closed.gif",\
decorators: \[{\
attrs: {alt: "Folder"}\
}]\
}]

} ]\
},
