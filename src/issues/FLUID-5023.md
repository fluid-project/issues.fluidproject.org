When a grade is added to a model component using a demands block and more than one instance of that component are created, the instances end up using the actual default model: modifications of one of the components model, using its applier, will modify the other component's model and the defaults for  the component.

Test case:\
<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/FLUID-5023/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2438-L2476>

Notes on the test case:\
1\) If you comment out the gradeNames in the demands block, the tests pass.\
2\) If you add the grade through the defaults instead of the demands, the tests pass.
