This issue consolidates tracking of tasks related to the initial Learning Dashboard implementation.

This is part of the "Preference Exploration and Self-Assessment" work described at <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Preference+Exploration+and+Self-Assessment> on the wiki.

The order of the subtasks below is, roughly, priority order.

For the first prototype the overall implementation approach will be to:

* implement persistence and time-based querying using PouchDB
* create Infusion-based components that are time-aware and persistable via PouchDB
* if possible, simulate per-user authentication and persistence

Some fast prototyping to understand the problem space better is at <https://github.com/waharnum/journal>
