Currently, Infusion's [Vagrant provisioning variables](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/0f226e56725f1ebd6fdd5c27149b2fa3c22affa0/provisioning/vars.yml#L7) are set up to use Node.js 0.10.40. This is a very old version, and we should upgrade to the latest LTS version of Node.js instead.

Also, we still use Fedora 22 instead of the latest, Fedora 23. By upgrading, those developers who are also developing on the GPII will require one less vagrant box installed on their computers.
