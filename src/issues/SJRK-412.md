Picking up on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6560#icft=FLUID-6560>, the "master" branch in the Storytelling Tool will be renamed to "main".&#x20;

This work entails doing the actual renaming of the branch in its various locations as well as updating the GitHub Actions workflows to refer to "main" where necessary.
