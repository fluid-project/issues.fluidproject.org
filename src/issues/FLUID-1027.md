The first file in the file queue should have focus, when the file queue is focused.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open either version of the uploader from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/uploader/inline/index.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/uploader/pop-up/index.html>&#x20;

2\) Add several files to the file queue.

3\) tab to the file queue. Notice that the whole file queue has focus, and not just the first file.
