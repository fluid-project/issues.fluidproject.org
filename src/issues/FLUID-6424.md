This is only an issue affecting the work in progress FLUID-6148 branch. During our reimplementation of fluid.notifyInitModel we have managed to swap the order of effects so that any material arriving in a component's model purely via relays does not end up triggering modelListeners. This was found when continuing to modernise the gpii-app code which contains definitions like so:

```java
fluid.defaults("gpii.qss.buttonPresenter", {
    ...
        modelRelay: {
            title: {
                target: "title",
                singleTransform: {
                    type: "fluid.transforms.free",
                    func: "gpii.qss.buttonPresenter.getTitle",
                    args: [
                        "{gpii.qss}.model.isKeyedIn",
                        "{that}.model.item.schema.title"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        modelListeners: {
            title: {
                "this": "{that}.dom.title",
                method: "text",
                args: ["{change}.value"]
            },
```
