Right now the nav on the Storytelling Project sites does not indicate the current page. A "Home" link should be added to the nav (which takes user back to landing page), along with a current page indicator. Also, the "Start Your Story" / "Explore Tool" button should not appear on the Story Tool page, since its function is to open the Story Tool page.
