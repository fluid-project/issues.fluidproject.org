When Weavly is loaded without an explicit theme parameter in the URL (or none in local storage, in the case of loading with a URL with no parameters), it defaults to the ‘light’ theme. Whereas in the Theme menu, the “Default” option sets the ‘mixed’ theme.

Steps to reproduce:

* Load Weavly with the following URL: <https://deploy-preview-138--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?p=>

Expected:

* The mixed theme

Actual:

* The light theme

There are 3 places in App.js where a default theme value is set. We should make them consistently set to ‘mixed’:
