Adding a file with a long file name to the upload queue, hides information in the upload queue. The long file name should be shortenned with (...) to show the beginning, middle, and end. Currently it stretches to the end of the upload queue and pushes the file size and remove button out of view. If there are other files in the upload queue, their size and remove button will be out of view as well.

Steps to Reproduce:

1\) Open one of the versions of Uploader from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/html/uploader.html>

2\) Add some files with short file names. (notice that everything displays appropriately)

3\) Add another file with a long file name. (notice how it pushed the file size and remove icon out of view)
