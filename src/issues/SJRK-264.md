Remove the "baseTheme" key from the clientConfig values returned by sjrk.storyTelling.server.getClientConfig()

This relates very closely and perhaps could be solved by the work outlined in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-256#icft=SJRK-256>, and it may remove the need for sjrk.storyTelling.loadCustomThemeFiles()
