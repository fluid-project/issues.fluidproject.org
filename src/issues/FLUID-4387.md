Currently, the build-README.txt file instructs users to remove the older copy of Rhino installed by Ant. This is something a user may choose to do, replacing it with a newer copy. But since Rhino 1.7R3 is distributed directly in the Infusion source code tree, users can equally well just use the -lib flag to specify an alternative location for Rhino.

We should update the read me file and build script wiki page to correct this.
