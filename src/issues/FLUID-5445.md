1\. Open up a separated panel demo such as <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/>

2\. Click "show display preferences" to open the prefs editor;

3\. Quickly click on "hide" then "show" (easier to do by using keyboard). The iframe opens but the main page content overlaps the content of the iframe.

If you wait a sufficient amount of time between clicking "hide" and "show", the issue doesn't appear.&#x20;
