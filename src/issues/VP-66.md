We have added support for Data URLs in the \<track> element support for Captionator. At the moment, it's a fairly simple implementation that doesn't do the following things:

1\. Handle all the variations of data URLs\
2\. Decode Base64-encoded data URLs\
3\. Check that the data in the data URL is actually a valid WebVTT document

Here's an example of a slightly more robust DataURL parser, which we should steal from (I hear the author's an ok guy):
