Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the [UIO demo](https://build-infusion.fluidproject.org/demos/uioptions/)
2. Open the prefs editor
3. Adjust the line spacing preference
4. Notice that the sliding panel tab is pushed down the page.

The line spacing should not affect the prefs editor container and should probably just be set to a fixed line-height.
