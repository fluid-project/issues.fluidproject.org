We have a function in App.js that focuses on the first element with a given selector.  We use this for the keyboard commands, but there are a lot of one-off blocks that handle focus in pretty much the same way.  This ticket covers moving the focus function to \`Utils.js\` and standardising all usages in \`App.js\` and the various places that use similar patterns.
