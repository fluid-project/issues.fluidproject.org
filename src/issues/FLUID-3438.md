Javascript Unit Tests are all broken, because they are expecting the fetching of the template to be syncronous

The unit tests were refactored to use the updated jqUnit in trunk, which performs the fetching of templates synchronously. However, the infusion builder is being deployed with the Infusion 1.1.2 which  still has the fetching of templates performed asynchronously.&#x20;
