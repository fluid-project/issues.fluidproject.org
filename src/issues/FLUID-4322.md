The following pastie: <http://pastie.org/2005216>&#x20;

```java
<div class="fl-progEnhance-enhanced fl-container-flex30">
<div class="d-uploader-queue" tabindex="0">
<div id="files:" class="d-uploader-file fl-col-flex2" tabindex="-1">
<div class="d-uploader-file-icon-container fl-col">
<div id="files:1" class="d-uploader-file fl-col-flex2" tabindex="-1">
<div class="d-uploader-file-icon-container fl-col">
<div id="files:2" class="d-uploader-file fl-col-flex2" tabindex="-1">
<div class="d-uploader-file-icon-container fl-col"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
```

shows some markup which was obtained from the renderer during work on the Uploader. It should be impossible for such nesting-corrupted markup ever to be generated, we should look into the particular situation and characterise it, hopefully leading to a bug fix.
