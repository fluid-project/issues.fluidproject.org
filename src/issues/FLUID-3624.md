If you paste two newline characters in a row into the CKEditor, the text following the two newlines is placed after the existing text.&#x20;

To recreate this issue:

1\. in a text editor place the following: \
abc\<newline>\<newline>def\
2\. copy the text into your buffer.\
3\. open the rich text inline edit demo: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/demo.html>\
4\. activate the CKEditor\
4\. without doing anything else, paste the text from memory.

Notice that the 'abc' is before the existing text and the 'def' is after the existing text.&#x20;

This is not a problem in FF3.6 or in Tiny MCE editor.
