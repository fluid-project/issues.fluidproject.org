The following is the proposal:\n\nFluid Components\n\n* downloads and demos\n* release notes (release pages for various releases, should also\\\n  contain link to manual)\n* source code (links to SVN, and different bundles)\n* designs (design patterns, designs for current and upcoming components)\n* user manual (how to install, run, test, integrate Fluid components)\n\nKnowledge Base (this category seems a bit ambiguous now â€“ see question above)\n\n* user experience (other wiki pages related to design and UX)\n* development (other wiki pages related to development)\n\nCommunity\n\n* meetings\n* current work (will include link to planned future work)\n* how to contribute\n* disciplines (may be moved into Knowledge Base - UX/Design section)\n* discussions (points to Mailing lists, Breeze, IRC, IM, also Meetings)\n* Contributor directory (hopefully some content to be automatically\\\n  pulled from Wiki profile pages)\n\nAbout Fluid\n\n* aims and goals\n* contact us\n"
