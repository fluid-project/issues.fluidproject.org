I think the main thing is to get something to developers with a story card to implement simple text edit demo in section into.  Good luck!  And if we need to chat briefly next week I'll try to find time.  Call me on my cell.\n"

Create basic wire frame for inline edit in section info.   The main priority is to show simple text edit.  Section name and location could be simple text edit fields.  Next is the dropdown for groups.  We'll eventually need to think through inline edit holistically in Section Info but that's not urgent and we can work through that in the design pair when Daphne is back from vacation.
