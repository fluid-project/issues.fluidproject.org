Keyboard reordering all portlets to left column causes the "Image Lightbox" portlet's title to be partially hidden below the portlet's icon.

steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/portal/portal.html>

2\) Using the keyboard, move all of the portlets from the right side to the left.&#x20;

Notice that the Title for the "Image Lightbox" is partly hidden by the portlet's icon

Note that this doesn't occur when you reorder using the mouse.
