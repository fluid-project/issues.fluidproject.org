At the moment, users can provide their own markup nested within the video tag for graceful degradation. This is a good basic scheme, but we probably want to ship built-in support for gracefully degrading to a few other video players where HTML 5 video support is unavailable. Out of the box, I imagine we might want to include support for the YouTube player and QuickTime.

Open questions: are the JavaScript APIs for some of these player technologies good enough to support our own chrome and even caption display? YouTube, for example, seems to have a fairly rich scripting API.
