Several of them currently don't, FE:\
<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/demos/inlineEdit/index.html#L55>\
Should be "\</figure>".

There are also markup issues in some other demos linked from <http://build.fluidproject.org/> that exist in separate repos, such as  <http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/> - they aren't being tackled by this PR.

Additionally, some Javascript components created for the demos have problems with their markup - see FLUID-5994 as one example. These should be corrected separately, since they're somewhat more complex cases.

Notably, the "check serialized DOM" bookmarklet at <https://validator.w3.org/nu/about.html> will show problems with the markup generated by Javascript components; putting in the page URL at <https://validator.w3.org/nu/> will show only the markup as initially delivered by the server (thanks Justin Obara for helping figure this out...)
