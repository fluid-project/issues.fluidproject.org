When the user clicks on a phrase in the transcript window, the video scrubs to that spot. The "current" phrase in the transcript area is supposed to always be highlighted, and since the video has scrubbed to the clicked-on phrase, it is the "current" phrase, but most times, it doesn't receive the correct highlight (solid blue background.

To reproduce:

1\. Display transcripts and play the video to start the transcript-highlighting.\
2\. Pause the video.\
3\. Click on a phrase other than the currently-highlighted phrase in the transcript window.

The video will scrub, but most times, the clicked-on phrase does NOT receive the highlight (sometimes, it does)
