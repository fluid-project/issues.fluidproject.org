This is a trivial issue in isolation but may represent a small problem in implementation. I feel very picky reporting it.

Title tooltip shows correctly when hovering over text. It also shows to the right of the text all the way to the end of the containing cell. I was looking at the Sakai Announcements testing demo page.
