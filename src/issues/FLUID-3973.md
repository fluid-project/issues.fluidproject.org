When user selects "save and apply" or "cancel," they immediately see the effects of their selection on the page. When user selects "Reset" though, changes are only shown in the preview pane. They have to click "save and apply" before they actually get to see the effects. May be a minor inconsistency in expectations, since the three buttons are grouped together.&#x20;
