I've been manually making backups of the host volumes directories for the stories.floeproject.org site (running in Docker) before doing deploys.

We should, through creation of a Jenkins job, make it possible for others to perform this process, as it shouldn't require someone with SSH access to the server as a speedbump.

We also discussed making a second Jenkins job to run a cleanup process on the directory so that we avoid accumulating an excessive number of backups.
