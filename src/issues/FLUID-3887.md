The Rich Text Inline Edit component produces a highlight that implies that an entire container is clickable, while only the button is clickable.&#x20;

However, the tooltip text is accurate for keyboard interaction since you can press enter when the highlight appears to enter Edit mode. (See Fluid-3911).

Also, the tooltip appears when hovering over this larger region and states that you can click anywhere to Edit - which is incorrect.
