"Edit Appearance" just seems to imply "surfacy" changes.  I can't come up with an appropriate label right now but perhaps someone else has a better idea.  I looked at BBC which is where I think a lot of the benchmarking was done for it but I can't even find the options now.  They just have a "low graphics" link.
