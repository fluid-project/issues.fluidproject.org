The helpful and permissive JSON5 spec (<http://json5.org/>) seems well established and has a reference implementation at <https://github.com/aseemk/json5> and a grunt plugin <https://github.com/ragnarokkr/grunt-json5lint> . We should implement support for this format in our "config" files so that they can incorporate comments and a more permissive syntax.
