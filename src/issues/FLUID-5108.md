If both the source component and the supplied dynamic grade have option(s) that need to be passed down to a sub-component via IoCSS, the option(s) defined in the source component take precedence over the dynamic grade.&#x20;

The right behavior is vice versa.

The test case is created @ <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5108/src/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L3114-3150>
