There is an issue with excluding things in a certain directory and including others. This is a rare case since most modules are in their own directory. The one example right now where this is a problem is jQueryUICore and jQueryUIWidgets. The MyInfusion.js file is built correctly but the other files related to the module being excluded are copied into the build.&#x20;
