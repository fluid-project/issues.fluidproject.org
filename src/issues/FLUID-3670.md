G.1 Gnome+Firefox+Orca

Browser: ??\
Screen Reader: ??\
Tester: ??\
G.2 WindowsXP+Firefox+NVDA

Browser: Firefox v3.5.9\
Screen Reader: NVDA 2010.1\
Tester: Jan Richards

BROWSE mode

* "list with 8 items link 1 link 2 link 3 link 4 last out of list clickable link previous clickable link next link show combobox collapsed submenu 10 per page"
* when select a link no audio feedback
* controls appeared to be operable

FORMS mode

-also worked fine\
G.3 WindowsXP+Firefox+JAWS

Browser: Firefox v3.5.8\
Screen Reader: JAWS 10\
Tester: Phil Richards

PC Cursor Mode

* clicking on the combo box causes the audio to say "list box five", once I select something it says "combo box five"
* audio will read links when clicked
* I'm not sure how to get it to read any of the other text, it only reads links and the combo box, and when I click in an editable box it says "edit", but will not read any other text

Jaws Mode

* arrow up/down will move cursor line by line and audio will read the line
* arrow left/right will move cursor letter by letter and audio will read letter
* audio reads letters in links and numbers in editable boxes and combo box but gives no indication that they are clickable/editable and there seems to be no way to activate links/buttons with the keyboard

Virtual Cursor

* arrow up/down will read field by field, ie name, then another press for user id, another for points, etc
* when cursor is in an editable box like in the points column, up/down arrow will move it to the box above or below, but there is no way to leave the boxes.  Up/down will continue to read other lines, and left/right will read individual characters until you try to use left/right to get out of the edit box.  For example, if I'm in an edit box that says 87, whenever I press left it will say 8 over and over.  Pressing right once will cause it to say 7, but pressing right again will just say space over and over
* using arrow keys to read the top line will result in audio that says "show combo box collapsed ten per page"
* there appears to be no way to change the value in the combo box with the keyboard
* no way to activate links with the keyboard\
  G.4 WindowsXP+IE+NVDA

Browser: IE8

Screen Reader: NVDA 2010.1\
Tester: Phil Richards

BROWSE MODE

* controls appear to work fine
* no audio feedback when link is clicked

FOCUS MODE

* appears to work fine\
  G.5 WindowsXP+IE+JAWS

Browser: IE8

Screen Reader: JAWS 10\
Tester: Phil Richards

PC Cursor Mode

* Tab will move between links, editable boxes and combo box
* Audio will read the name of the link or the value in the box, and for the combo box says to use the arrow keys to change the value
* No way to click on links
* Arrow keys do change value in combo box, and text in grade boxes is editable
* Only text that the audio reads is that which is selected via tab, so none of the non link/editable text is read

Jaws Mode

* Moving cursor from line to line with arrows will cause audio to read all text on the line, but it does not indicate if something is a link or is editable
* No way to click links, change value of combo box, or type in editable boxes

Virtual Cursor Mode

* Arrow keys will move through each individual field/item
* Audio indicates links, combo box, editable boxes
* Possible to change value of combo box and edit text boxes, but no way to click on links
