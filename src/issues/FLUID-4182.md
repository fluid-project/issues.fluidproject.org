      "body": "Seems to be based off of jquery ui's ui-icon class:\n\n.ui-icon: Base class to be applied to an icon element. Sets dimensions to 16px square block, hides inner text, sets background image to \"content\" state sprite image. Note: .ui-icon class will be given a different sprite background image depending on its parent container. For example, a ui-icon element within a ui-state-default container will get colored according to the ui-state-default's icon color.\n\nAfter declaring a \".ui-icon\" class, you can follow up with a second class describing the type of icon you'd like. Icon classes generally follow a syntax of .ui-icon-{icon type}~~{icon sub description}~~{direction}. For example, a single triangle icon pointing to the right looks like this: .ui-icon-triangle-1-e&#x20;\n"

      "body": "fl-icon in fss-layout.css doesn't seem to be used at all in any of the demos etc. But it seems to just establish a 16x16 space, and move the text out. A user would then add another style for their particular icon image to be dropped into this space. The benefits of doing this vs. just having an image with alt-text: themes can replace the image with the normally hidden text.&#x20;\n\nfl-icon seems to be used differently in fss-mobile-layout.css where it's just used to establish icon sizes.\n"

What is it? Do we need it? Does it work as it should?&#x20;

It is using text-indent.
