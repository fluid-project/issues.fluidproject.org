Currently only the in development ( master ) branch is publish. We should implement a means of publishing the latest stable release documentation alongside the in development docs. This will likely mean moving off of GitHub pages and into a self hosted environment.&#x20;

Currently by default docs.fluidproject.org redirects to <http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/> We'll probably either want to have a landing page where a user can select which version ( stable / dev ) to view or provide some other means of easily navigating between the two.
