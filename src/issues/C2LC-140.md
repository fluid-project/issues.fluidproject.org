Option to gradually add functions/features to the UI and customize UI complexity based on learners needs

Description from source:

* Some students needed fewer options to choose from to be able to stay on task - So we need to have an option for gradual addition/introduction of new items
* Start with a very simple layout and the least number of options and gradually build complexity

We could do paper prototypes and dev experiments

For 0.7:

* Implement the Actions panel menu
* A block cannot be hidden in the Action panel if it is currently being used in the program
