I think the problem is that the Reset button is different from the Save and Apply and the Cancel.  The Reset only acts on the preview but the other two are sort of finalizing the action and closing out UI Options.  Perhaps moving Reset up closer to the preview or under the settings themselves would help?  And then the button name could be \"Reset All\".  This probably needs a little more thought.\n"

I didn't expect the button to reset back to original settings.  If a user has done a lot of work, saved changes and later decides to go in an make another change but chooses reset, they may have lost a lot of work whether they meant to or not.  We should either have an undo or be more explicit with the button name, like, "reset to original" or something like that.
