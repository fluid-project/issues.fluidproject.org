      "body": "When updating jQuery UI we should take care to look at re-implementing the tooltip and tabs wrapper components. These should be brought up to modern standards. In particular for tooltip we should avoid the current idiom of creating new tooltips for each instance, rather we should share a single tooltip and move it around. Additionally, we should make sure that it supports all the modern features, e.g. custom-content (<http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content>)\n"

This is now essentially working in my branch (minus the tooltip component which needs a big rewrite) and I expect this to be done in a day or two. It should be merged with trunk within a couple of weeks - the 1.5 release process should hopefully follow not long after that, although we would like to get our documentation into better shape.\n"

Upgrade Infusion to use the latest version of jQuery UI, Qunit, and 1.x line of jQuery.

Since we still need to support IE 8 we cannot jump to the 2.x line of jQuery yet.
