Create a testing grid to facilitate reliable manual testing of various situations within the Storytelling Tool which takes into account varying:

* hardware setups
* operating systems and versions
* browsers and versions
* actions and sequences

The aim of the grid will be to try to tease out regressions as we work on the UI and server projects.

The grid should be added to or linked from a Floe Project wiki page for the Storytelling Tool.
