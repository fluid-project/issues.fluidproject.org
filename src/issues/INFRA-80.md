This is of lesser importance for January than other tasks, but would be nice to have as an option:

* Additional Docker Infrastructure (nice to have)
* Run a private registry
* Push build container to this registry along with Docker hub
* Prefer this registry over Docker Hub for usage within datacentre&#x20;
