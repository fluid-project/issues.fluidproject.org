It might be a bit brute force and inelegant, but hopefully it's a start that can be refined.\n\nSome issues I've noticed so far:\n\n* when a menu is expanded, it is dark gray, so I've added a white border. The border only appears on the left and top.\n* the focus border is added around links that already have a colour change to indicate focus.\n* \\<input>s and \\<textarea>s don't get any border (though they do get the blinking cursor)\n* the two items in the \"Howdy...\" menu get keyboard focus, but the menu doesn't pull down, so there's nothing to see: confusing\n* tab order is not necessarily ideal\n"

The Wordpress admin interface is keyboard accessible, but focus styling is poor, so as you tab around, it's hard to tell where focus is.
