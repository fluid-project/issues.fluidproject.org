Using the protocol created do user testing with 3 to 5 users.  We won't do tests at both Toronto and Berkeley as there is some overhead in the setup.   Likely the tests will be done either in Mike's lab or at the ATRC.

Mike Elledge at Michigan State and Laurie at U Toronto will be good resources to help with this.
