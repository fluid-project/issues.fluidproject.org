Find some "good" examples of EPUB books and evaluate the user experience in reader systems. The criteria of "good" will need to be defined as part of this research (i.e what features, metadata, markup).

Possible reader systems include:

* Readium
* Calibre (Open Source)
* iBooks
* Aldiko (Android)
* Braille readers
* Audio-only reader

Work should be documented under <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Inclusive+EPUB>
