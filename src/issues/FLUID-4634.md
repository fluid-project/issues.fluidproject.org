      "body": "Hi Justin - unfortunately this is currently \"expected behaviour\" due to the way context matching rules were implemented. As explained in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4707#icft=FLUID-4707> it would currently cause too much upheaval to rewrite these rules due to the change in meaning of a large number of already written demands blocks, so we will have to live with it until the framework is rewritten wholesale for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4392#icft=FLUID-4392>. In the meantime, a workaround would be to issue a contradicting demands block with no contexts which will still take priority over your block in mismatched situations - for example in your case you ought to be able to have success by writing&#x20;\n\nfluid.demands(\"testDemandedEvent\", \\[], \\[\"{arguments}.0\"]);\n\nwhich will take priority in all mismatching situations. Please could you rewrite your test case so that it cleans up the static environment (in a finally block) before it concludes - you can see examples of this style in FluidIoCTests.js\n"

If multiple components use the same name for a boiled event, the arguments specified in a demands block will collide if they share any of the same context. Meaning that in all instances the same demands block will be used to resolve the demanded options for the event.&#x20;
