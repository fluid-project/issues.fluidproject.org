Add a "skip to content" button or link to the UI to allow users to skip to the main content of the page, bypassing UIO and any banners and introductory content. Consider what this could mean for each page:

* Edit: skips to the editor area
* Browse: skips to the list of stories
* View: skips to the title of the story
