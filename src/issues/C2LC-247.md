* Serialize the contents of the scene: character position, character direction, path segments drawn
* Create a CharacterStateSerializer
  * serialize(characterState: CharacterState): string
  * deserialize(text: string): CharacterState
* Representation:
  * \<xPos>\<yPos>\<direction>\<path segments>
  * Where each path segment is a series of 4 characters:
    * \<x1>\<y1>\<x2>\<y2>
  * Encoding for positions:
    * 0: 0
    * Positive offset from the origin: lower case letters
    * Negative offset from the origin: upper case letters
    * This enables us to support a grid up to 53x53
  * Encoding for direction:
    * Single character representing eighths of a turn (the internal representation of direction in CharacterState)
    * N: 0
    * NE: a
    * E: b
    * SE: c
    * S: d
    * SW: e
    * W: f
    * NW: g
* Example:
  * After running the following: <https://develop-0-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=0.5&p=l45f1r90f2>
  * cac00aAaAca
  * Character is at: (3, 1) = ca
  * Character is facing SE: c
  * First path segment: (0, 0) -> (1, -1) = 00aA
  * Second path segment (1, -1) -> (3, 1) = aAca
* Add a new URL parameter “c” for CharacterState
* Make the program representation more concise (to reduce the length of the URL)
  * forward1: 1
  * forward2: 2
  * forward3: 3
  * left45: A
  * left90: B
  * left180: D
  * right45: a
  * right90: b
  * right180: d
