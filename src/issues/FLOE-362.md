When you switch from the first set of icons to the 2nd set by pressing "Next" button, a green checkmark is visible floating over an empty space.

This happens only in Safari.

The checkmark disappears if the tooltip text is repositioned by moving the mouse slightly, or by switching focus to something else using keyboard.

This may be fixed with <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLOE-352#icft=FLOE-352>.
