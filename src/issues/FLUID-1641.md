After editing an Inilne Edit field and applying changes using the Enter key, pressing up or down arrow moves a blinking text cursor around the page. Can't activate and edit an inline edit field once in this state.

Moving focus off the page (i.e. by changing windows) fixes this.&#x20;

This happens in both bSpace Section Info and Sakai Announcements demos.
