      "body": "keep in mind Daphne's feedback from fluid-work on current round 1 protocol:&#x20;\n\nTry asking the user to complete a goal, like \"edit the appearance of X to meet your needs\" or \"show me how you would change the interface settings to make if more comfortable for you\", rather then stepping them through an activity.  So, for example, you might not want to say \"you decide to save them\" because you'll miss whether they realize they have to do an explicit save.  And actually, a rule of thumb is never to use a term that is on the interface so my suggestion of \"appearance\" needs a different word too.  The current questions should uncover specific interaction issues but won't uncover much about how UI Options conceptually works for users.   What are the questions they will come to it with and can they accomplish those?\n"
