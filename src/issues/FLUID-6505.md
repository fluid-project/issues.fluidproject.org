1\. Open [the preferences framework demo](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/) or [the UIO demo](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/) on the build site;\
2\. Open UIO and select any high/low contrast theme;\
3\. Close and re-open UIO so the select theme is applied to UIO panels;\
4\. Use "tab" to move focus to the "text style" input box;\
5\. The border of the input box disappears.

The correct behavior is to have a proper focus styling for the "text style" input box.
