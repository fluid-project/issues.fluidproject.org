It seems to be used more like a call to fluid.registerNamespace with a method in its namespace used as a [listener](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/pager/js/PagedTable.js#L101).\n"

Currently, the Pager supports three top-level options that are used to configure its RangeAnnotator subcomponent:\
annotateColumnRange\
tooltipDelay\
tooltipId

Since these options are specifically for configuring the subcomponent, they should be defined as options to the subcomponent itself, and passed in through the subcomponent definition object.
