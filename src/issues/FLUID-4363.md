"Comic Sans" and "Verdana" cause the "Show Table of Contents" label to wrap and push the headers too low.

Steps to reproduce

1\) Open the Full w/ preview UIO demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FullPreviewUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>

2\) Change the Text Style to either "Comic Sans" or "Verdana".\
Notice that the "Show Table of Contents" label wraps and the headers are misaligned with their icons.
