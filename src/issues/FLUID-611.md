The createUploadCompleteHandler function contains the following line:

fileQueueComplete(uploaderContainer, options, progressBar, fragmentSelectors);

However, "options" is undefined in this context. Looks like a bad copy-and-paste, not caught because the no-server-side demo doesn't exercise that function.

I've worked around it by just adding "options" to the parameter list:

var createUploadCompleteHandler = function (uploaderContainer, progressBar,  fragmentSelectors, status, options) {\
...\
upload\_complete\_handler: createUploadCompleteHandler (uploaderContainer, progressBar, fragmentSelectors, status, options),
