The current sounds played on turns and movement are "panned" left or right depending on the position of the character on the scene.  Since Daniel's work to add a larger scrollable scene, this panning is misaligned, i.e. it considers row K (not even the centre yet) to be the furthest right edge.  Sounds continue to play at least in Chrome, but the panning needs to either:

1. Be updated to reflect the overall size of the scene.
2. Be removed to avoid confusing users when they scroll throughout the larger scene.
3. Be updated to reflect the position within the scrolled scene.

I would argue for either option 1 or 2, but we should discuss in our next meeting.
