Create story cards to describe user activities that are supported in the pager.  There can be broken down by the development team to understand the work they need to do.

This can be an iterative activity.  For instance, if there are some things the developers can do now, we can write up a card.  Then once the designs are complete the rest of the story cards can be completed.

There are still some questions about how and where we want to document story cards but those should be answered soon. &#x20;
