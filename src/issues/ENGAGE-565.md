Create new scenarios that focus more particularly on the areas where little exploration has occured. (based on "areas explored doc")

Addressing:\
•  in-museum experiences within the different museum types for kiosks and mobile scenarios \
•  diversifying interactions for different visitor-groups/ages for mobile scenarios\
• diversifying visit style type to accommodate for different kinds of interactions (non-tour-driven visits)\
• Focusing on how different platforms may interact with each other within a museum
