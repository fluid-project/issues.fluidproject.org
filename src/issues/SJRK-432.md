Sentry.io is a SaaS solution for observability and debugging of applications. It allows us to get detailed information about errors, why applications are failing and to track transactions.

Sentry.io granted us a sponsored account which gives access to 5 million errors and 10 thousands transactions per month.

It would be interesting to integrate it with the SJRK Story Telling too so we have better visibility about errors in production (and also during development).

There is a getting started guide here: <https://docs.sentry.io/>
