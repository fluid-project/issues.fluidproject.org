The system includes a few simple stories that teaches students about the basics of coding as they interact with it - As they read along, they can change parameters, build sequences, and debug - This can be included as a tutorial for the product

 \
Details from co-design:

To make storytelling interactive, we could have a system where a robot or graphical turtle moves on a sequence of event blocks, and when the robot is on an event where Pete steps on an object, make some sound feedback like strawberries are getting mushed, and ask participants questions like “Pete stepped on \_\_\_\_\_ what colour is his shoes now?”

 

Options  1. Paper prototypes or 2. Interactive mockups
