Tests fail for test #8  and for this the pull request was issued ttps://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/pull/45\n\n2\\. The issue Cindy observing javascript error \"INVALID\\_STATE\\_ERR: DOM Exception 11\" is NOT related to Video Player Controls Tests: Fullscreen button\" and is NOT related to webkitEnterFullScreen(). This javascript console error is present even if you remove all tests and leave only a Play Button test.\n"

1\. Run "videoPlayer/tests/html/VideoPlayerControls-test.html" in Chrome, javascript error "INVALID\_STATE\_ERR: DOM Exception 11" is thrown on the screen at "Video Player Controls Tests: Fullscreen button", test #8.

2\. Commenting out the call on webkitEnterFullScreen() in VideoPlayer\_controllers.js gets rid of the on-screen error but the same error still shows up in the chrome debugger console.
