That option is not available through the Web inteface and there is a bug opened for that [here](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33056).\n\nIf this is not causing an issue for end users, I'd suggest waiting for `clean-remote` to be implemented by upstream (or work on it ourselves).\n"

For FLUID-5892 the manual tests for the prefs editors were split into distinct pages for the native HTML and jQuery UI slider variants. However, the build site is still able to access the old index.html file.&#x20;

old:

* <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/>

new:

* <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/index-nativeHTML.html>
* <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/index-jQueryUI.html>

Exploring the workspace on the Jenkins server shows that the correct files are in place in the directory, so it seems likely that it is an issue with the server that is deploying the build site artifacts.
