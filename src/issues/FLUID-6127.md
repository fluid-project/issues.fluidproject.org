Model listeners which listen on a wildcard path ending in \* are not notified when a DELETE change removes one of the leaves of interest - for example, with this definition:

```java
modelListeners: {
            updateComponentView: {
                path: "idToPath.*",
                funcName: "fluid.author.componentGraph.updateComponentView",
                args: ["{that}", "{change}.path", "{change}.value"]
            }
```

a change of that.applier.change("idToPath.thing", null, "DELETE") will not trigger the notification. The logic in fluid.matchChanges is faulty and is not prepared for this case.
