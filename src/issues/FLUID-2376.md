The name and value space of the aria-grabbed state (formerly "aria-grab") changed just weeks before the last call draft of the ARIA spec.  The rationale was consistency in form with other boolean properties (e.g., aria-checked).

In brief:

* the name is now "aria-grabbed".
* the presence of "aria-grabbed" marks the element as "draggable".
  * if aria-grabbed="false", the element is **not** in the set of objects marked for dragging.
  * if aria-grabbed="true", the element is in the set of grabbed objects marked for dragging.
  * if aria-grabbed="undefined", the element is not draggable and can't be in the set.  The same is true if the aria-grabbed attribute is missing entirely.
