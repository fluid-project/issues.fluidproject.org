After updating jQuery UI to 1.8.11, the layout reorderer unit tests no longer crash IE 9 on page load. However, there are still failing unit tests.

3.10 - Temporary moved state is cleared.\
(See screenshot-1.jpg)

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the layout reorderer unit tests, notice that test 3.10 fails.\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/component-tests/reorderer/html/LayoutReorderer-test.html>
