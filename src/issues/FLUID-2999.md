Personally, I'm finding I want to completely revise the look of the page once I had put it up on the website, and I'm doing things like moving controls around, etc. I'm guessing that if anyone else wants to use the component, their likely to do the same thing.\n\nCan you please comment on this?\n\nLaurel &#x20;\n"
