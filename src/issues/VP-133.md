Found by Cindy:

Clicking scrubber to advance/rewind video doesn't always respond properly. Sometimes need to click the scrubber twice to position to the first click location.

This is due to a time delay with the flash fallback in between calling setCurrentTime() and "currentTime" property gets really set. I've placed in an ugly fix using setTimeout(),

<https://github.com/cindyli/videoPlayer/blob/FLUID-4775/js/VideoPlayer_media.js#L178-184>

It doesn't fix the issue completely. The problem still occurs intermittently, I thinking depending on how fast the "currentTime" gets updated.
