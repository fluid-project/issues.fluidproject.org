The tab in inline edit was read as two full tabs.\n"

When entering a 'tab' character into an in-line edit field, the 'tab' is displayed as a double tab when out of edit mode.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the in-line edit demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Open one of the in-line edit fields into edit mode

3\) Cut and paste this "before tab		after tab" into the in-line edit field

4\) Press 'enter' to leave the edit mode. Notice that the tab is now a double tab. This is easier to see by using the mouse to gradually highlight the text from one end to the other.

If you re-enter edit mode, notice that the tab is still a single tab
