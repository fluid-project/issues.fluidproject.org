In particular we need to update to the latest dev release in the <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6580#icft=FLUID-6580> line ( 3.0.0-dev.20210204T181946Z.3ed160b36.<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6580#icft=FLUID-6580> ) to get the fix for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6593#icft=FLUID-6593> that we'll need to for testing SJRK-403 and SJRK-402. At the same time we should explore updating the other dependencies that are out of date.
