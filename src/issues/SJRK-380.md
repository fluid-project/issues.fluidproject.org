Text blocks:

Replace "Begin typing here" in text content area to read "Add text content here", to be consistent with "Add block heading here". Add horizontal division line to distinguish the heading area from the text content area. Remove "...(for screenreaders)", since alt-text is not useful just for screen readers. See mockup attached.

Media blocks:

Update placeholder text to be more descriptive, adding the word "here" and the media type, as in "Add video description here". See mockup attached.
