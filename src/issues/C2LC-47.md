**Activities**

Establish open collaboration tools (wiki, issue tracker, discussion forums)

Design and implement project website

Design and implement the Coding to Learn open resource repository

Research and do a comparative functional analysis of current learning to code environments

Research the existing technology infrastructure within environments that we would like the Coding to Learn and Create software to be used

Gather a list of existing accessible coding resources to inform the open resource repository

Consult with community partners on co-design session topics

Prepare a co-design kit (for sessions to be held in Milestone #2) based upon the recruitment methods in the IDRC co-design guide

Contact learners and educators including those working in integrated schools to assemble list of prospective co-design participants

Start design of the programming environment and connection features

Do exploratory implementation of programming environment and connection features

Â
