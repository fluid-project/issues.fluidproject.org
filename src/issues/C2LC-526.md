      "body": "Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, but the contrast theme mockups on the Design System page in Figma don't match the current design for more than just focus, and there are a few things left to the imagination.  For example:\n\n1. The \"off\" and \"on\" styles for the audio toggle (which appears against a black background) are not correct.\n2. The \"off\" and \"on\" styles for the pen down (which appears against a black background) are inverted.\n3. The \"off\" and \"on\" styles for the expand add nodes toggle (which appears against a white background) are also inverted.\n4. The focus examples only show \"on\" buttons, it's not clear what to do for \"off\" buttons for both white and black backgrounds.\n\nWe should review with Sepi to clarify.\n\nI also noticed that the hover styles for IconButton are wrong, which I will open a separate ticket for.\n\n \n"

Focus applies a black border around the toggle button, when its outer colour is black.
