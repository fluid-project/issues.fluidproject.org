From a design crit suggestion by @@Jonathan Hung, it would be good to implement accessibility metadata for stories as described atÂ <https://handbook.floeproject.org/AccessibilityMetadata.html>

How exactly this would be done (client-side and server-side interactions, etc) would need to be discussed but the idea is very good - we can infer a lot of this information from the content types and whether or not affordances like simplified text have been included.
