These have been updated to fluid.log, but unfortunately the sample doesn't seem to work any more - the 0.8 version of the reorderer no longer works,\\\napparently because of some form of JQuery UI conflict. Other than this, I confirmed that no unguarded references to \"console\" occur in our codeset. Some 3rd party code (jquery.selectbox, tinyMCE, testrunner, etc.) do make use of console.log, as do we as an option in Fluid.js, but these either perform a guard to check for existence, or (more disagreeably in the case of 3rd party code) assign a dummy value to it. We can sign this one off\n"

Committed code should not have console.log() functions

at least nested.html has a call to console.log
