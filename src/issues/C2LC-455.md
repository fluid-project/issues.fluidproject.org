This issue serves as a place to review and document issues when using Weavly at a high browser zoom level.    Per [the WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html), at a minimum we want to support a zoom level of  200%.  Ideally we would like to support even higher levels.

The process I have in mind is:

1. &#x20;Review all open issues and associate scaling issues with this ticket.  If it's not already documented, we need to document the issues with portions of the UI moving offscreen.
2. Test high zoom levels with a range of browsers and window sizes.
3. Test with browser-specific zoom/accessibility options, such as:
   1. The "zoom text only" option enabled in Firefox.
   2. The "never use font sizes smaller than" feature in Safari.
   3. The "very large" font size override in Chrome.
