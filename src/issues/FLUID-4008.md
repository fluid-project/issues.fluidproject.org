Don't think the file list should be focused after adding more files - the focus is on the Upload button (and "Add More" - see FLUID-3890).

To recreate:\
-add files, tab to the file list, and use the arrow keys to move through the list\
-tab to 'add more' button, add more files\
-the last file selected in the file list gets highlighted as if it's focused\
-upload button focused
