If the add or delete was selected before run, the user can add or delete during the run.

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Click Connect to Dash and connect
* Create a program with a few commands
* Press delete or add 
* Click the run button when delete or add is still pressed
* Click on the program to add or delete a step while the program is running

Expected: Program shouldn’t be modifiable when the program is running

Actual: You can delete or add steps to the program

Notes:

* We are currently disabling editor action buttons when program is running; however if editor action is already pressed before running the program, you can still modify the program
* We need to set selectedAction state to null when program is running
