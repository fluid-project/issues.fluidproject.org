In Firefox 3.6 (Win XP), if the unit test page is open but not in focus while running, multiple tests will fail, specifically:

1. Fluid View Tests module: Dead man's blur test - excluded component one (2, 3, 5)
2. Fluid View Tests module: Dead man's blur test - excluded component two - b (2, 3, 5)
3. Fluid View Tests module: Dead man's blur test - excluded component excluded (2, 3, 5)

To reproduce:

1\. Go to <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/core/html/FluidView-test.html>\
2\. Put window out of focus immediately (just as the unit tests start running)\
3\. Aforementioned unit tests will fail
