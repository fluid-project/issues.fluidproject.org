We have a placeholder page for this:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Model+Transformation>

We need to include (not exhaustive):

* transforms now in "fluid.transforms" namespace
* many new transforms available (see ModelTransformationTransforms.js)
* transforms now specified with "transform:" instead of "expander:"&#x20;
* only supporting 'input' and 'inputPaths' instead of value in the expanders
* Several new transform functions
* "standardTransformation" -> standardTransformFunction
