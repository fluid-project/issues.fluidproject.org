Draggable elements move around static elmenents during addition and removal of elements in a column

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Layout Customizer Springboard example from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/LayoutCustomizer.html>

2\) Look at the second example

3\) Move some draggable elements from Column A to the bottom of Column B.

4\) Move a draggable element from Column C to the top of Column B. Notice that it appears to be added to the bottom of Column B.

5\) Move a draggable element from Column C to Column B between the first  static element and the draggable element.&#x20;

6\) Move any of the top draggable elements from Column B to any other column. Notice that it appears to take it from the bottom.

It's hard to tell from this example which elements are moving where but I would guess that the lower draggable elements are moving up to take the place of the higher draggable element that was moved.
