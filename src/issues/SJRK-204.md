Add a hover state over story links on the Browse page. Design to be provided by Sepideh Shahi and Caren Watkins

Â 

***Update***: the design is to have the background colour set to the same as the Etiquette section. If possible, also enlarge the item by about 2 or 3%, or possibly add a stroke to it, though either of these may disrupt the flow of the rest of the items.
