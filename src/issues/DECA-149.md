Steps to reproduce

1\) Start decapod and navigate to the Camera Calibration page

2\) Set the viewport to have a height of 642px or less (this is the full screen height of the viewport on a MacBook Pro 15" with a 1440 x 900 resolution)

Notice that a scrollbar appears on the right hand side and that the done button is below the fold.
