modify the wording on the form so that instructions and labels are more clear. Problematic elements include:

* "Contributors"
* "Delete"
* "Sources"
* "Upload" button

Upload button is not obvious - doesn't convey what happens when clicking: does it submit the form or just upload an image? Does my form data save itself so I don't have re-enter everything?&#x20;

"Sources" can be mistaken for URLs only.
