If you try the demo of the Exploration tool at <http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/> in Chrome or Safari, you'll notice that it reads the contents of the overlay panel without difficulty. However if you follow these steps, the page contents won't be read:

1\. Closing the overlay panel\
2\. Enabling â€œSpeak"

In both browsers, I hear "Text to Speech Enabled" and then silence.
