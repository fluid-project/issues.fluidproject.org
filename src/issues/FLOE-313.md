Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the first discovery tool

2\) Navigate to a panel that contains tooltips (e.g. text size).

3\) Place focus on one of the navigation buttons (e.g. next, back)

4\) Hover over one of the panels buttons (e.g. larger, smaller)

Notice that we can have two tooltips because the tooltips are for the different Infusion components.
