To give freedom of movement as required by the Reorderer and to avoid unwanted visual effects, the avatar should probably be injected as the very last element in the document.&#x20;

As an example, take a sortable ordered list. The avatar is appended to the container (an \<OL>), which creates 2 problems:\
1\) the avatar will increment the number to the list, so if I drag #3 in a 10 item list, the avatar becomes #11\
2\) the avatar is subject to all the CSS-P restrictions placed on the container (like overflow: hidden will crop out the avatar in unexpected ways)

A solution to this could be to place the avatar and the end of the document
