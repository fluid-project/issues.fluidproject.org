At the moment, it looks like My Collection's server-side code isn't successfully building up a valid model for the component to render. This might potentially be due to a bug in the by\_id Lucene view in the McCord database. Here's what I'm seeing:

The service correctly reads the user's collections and builds up a query to Lucene to get artifacts matching the artifacts in the user's personal collection. However, it seems that the view is not returning a set of full and valid artifact documents. As a result, when passed to the model mapping code in Engage, a corrupt model is produced with properties that are largely undefined.
