FLUID-4934 tasked us with researching the viability of using Font Icons in place of our traditional rasterized icons. We also discussed this on list and on the wiki.&#x20;

<http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2013-April/009016.html>\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Research+the+viability+of+using+icon+fonts+in+UI+Options>

The result of all of this was the decision to move to Font Icons. We should now look at replacing our existing rasterized icons with new font icons.
