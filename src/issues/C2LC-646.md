Currently we only scroll after moving. This means that if we play the program when the character is off screen, we will not scroll to the character until after the first movement.

Scroll the scene to show the character when playing the program is started, including when transitioning from Pause to Play.

Steps to reproduce:

* Make a program with some turns and a movement
* Scroll the scene so that the character is off-screen
* Play the program

Expected:

* The scene to scroll to show the character when the program is started

Actual:

* The scene does not scroll until the character moves
