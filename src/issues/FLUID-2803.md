slider and text field are far apart

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the UI Options example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uiOptions/html/UIOptions.html>

2\) Notice that the text field and slider are far appart. The slider is justified to the right of the accordion panel, while the text field is placed directly beside the label
