The test files for the server with storage are currently not working - should be easily fixable (renamed files), but noting in Jira to make sure it gets done.

Should also address fragility ofÂ sjrk.storyTelling.server.testServerWithStorageDefs.retrieveUploadedImage when this is done, see TODO at line 241.
