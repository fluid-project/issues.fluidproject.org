After uploading an image file that exceeds file size limit, the error message displayed is incorrect and unhelpful.

The error message should read something like: "Image file exceeds size limit" or something to that effect.

To reproduce:\
1\. Choose a large image file that exceeds the limit (i.e. 30MB)\
2\. Upload\
3\. Note: the error message is incorrect after uploading.
