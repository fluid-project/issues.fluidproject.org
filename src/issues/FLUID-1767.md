I created an inline edit field that had to change into a textarea. The html looks like this:

\<div class="inlineEditable">\
\<div id="txt\_aboutme" class="text">\</div>\
\<div class="editContainer">\
\<textarea class="edit">\</textarea>\
\</div>\
\</div>

This works, but if I hit enter while inside the edit mode, it switches back to view mode. This means I am\
unable to put enters inside my textarea, which is the whole points of a textarea.
