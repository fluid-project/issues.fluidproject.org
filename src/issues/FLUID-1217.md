Tell the user story.  A suggestion is to start with context scenarios describing what the user needs to do and see without getting into any interaction with the component.  Once we clearly understand what the user needs to do the context scenarios can be iterated on to describe how those needs are met with interaction in the system.  (For information on context and other types of scenarios see "About Face 2.0 or 3.0", Cooper).

Flesh out each primary and secondary scenario in this way.  Eventually these will become storyboards as we create wireframes for each step in the scenario.  They should be documented on the wiki in the component design space.
