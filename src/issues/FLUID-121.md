When the sort order is set to alphabetical, there is no keyboard access to the images at all. If a user wishes to view an image they would have to go into the slide show and scroll through the images to find the one they were looking for. The user should probably be able to traverse through the images with only the move option (ctrl-arrow key) being disabled.&#x20;
