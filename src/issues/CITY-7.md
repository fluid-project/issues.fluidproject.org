Since we are moving to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the static site generator, we'll need to create a template for the Inclusive Cities website (with UIO capabilities as seen in Alan Harnum's site).

* Understand how Hugo themes are structured and named
* Break up the current website design/layout into header, footer, content/posts
* Test and make sure layout is not broken
* Add UIO and ensure nothing is broken
