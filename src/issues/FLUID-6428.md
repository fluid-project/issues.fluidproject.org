It looks like this is an issue that only appears in the in-progress branch implementing immutable options for FLUID-6426. The Syllabification enactor tests at <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L293> contain some blocks which actually fail to resolve at all as a result of escaping issues:

```java
combined: {
                    ".flc-syllabification-injectWhenDisabled": "{that}.options.testOpts.injected.disabled.\.flc-syllabification-injectWhenDisabled",
                    ".flc-syllabification-injectWhenEnabled": "{that}.options.testOpts.injected.disabled.\.flc-syllabification-injectWhenEnabled"
                }
```

However, whilst they fail to resolve they now leave "mouse droppings" at the site where they are directed during initial observation, and {that}.options.testOptions.injected.disabled ends up with an mouse dropping of&#x20;

```java
"": undefined
```

It seems our modifications to the options evaluation workflow have hoisted the widespread ability to leave mouse droppings of "undefined" across the source of blocks into their target.
