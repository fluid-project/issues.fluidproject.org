* Open Transcripts
* Click on the "Catch a tiger by the toe" transcript with a breakpoint in captionator.js at line 1203\
  you will see that the currentTime propagated is 4.003 and then if you look at the .srt file the interval for this caption is

2

00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:05.99\
Catch a tiger by the toe

which means that time does not fall into this interval

This is the result of fluid.videoPlayer.transcript.convertToMilli which converts 00:00:04.03 to be 4003 ms which is incorrect. It should be 4030 instead.\
Also fluid.videoPlayer.transcript.convertToMilli would do the following conversion\
00:00:04.3 -> 4003 ms\
00:00:04.30 -> 4030 ms\
00:00:04.300 -> 4300 ms

which actually should be only one value which is 4300ms

00:00:04.03 -> 4003 ms\
00:00:04.030 -> 4030 ms\
00:00:04.3 -> 4003 ms

which actually should be 4030, 4030 and 4300 respectively
