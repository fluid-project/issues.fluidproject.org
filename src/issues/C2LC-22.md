It was introduced to manage state in the ProgramTextEditor (<https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/master/src/ProgramTextEditor.js>) but it's going to be some hassle to keep it when we introduce a richer program model. Let's see if we can just store a reference to the program (will be commandSequence after C2LC-21 above) and test object reference equality instead of the version number.
