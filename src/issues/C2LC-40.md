* Evolve incrementally from what we have now to what we want in the future
* Be willing to let some things go, but temporarily
* Continuous visibility/usability in development
* Release regularly (monthly? Six weeks?) so that we feel a sense of cadence and progress
* Each release, if possible, should include documentation and a video tutorial of how to use it, along with one or more inclusive activities to try with it
