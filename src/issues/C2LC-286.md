Notes:

* Keep the audio toggle control in its current position on the right hand side of the application header
* Remove the Theme selector; the Theme selector will be put back and updated for the new colours in C2LC-289
* Change the size of the Scene to 26 columns (A-Z) by 16 rows (1-16)
  * For this task, the Scene will be scrollable, but the column and row headers will be removed (to be implemented in C2LC-301)
* Adjust the Actions panel layout (2 columns or 1 depending on desktop/tablet/mobile)
* The add-node toggle switch and Delete All control will remain in their current positions on the right hand side of the Program header
  * For 0.7, we will not implement the "Line 1" row header
* Move the speed control to beside the Play controls
* Ensure that the layout adapts well as browser zoom changes

Not in scope for this task and to be implemented in later tasks:

* The Scene column and row headers will be implemented in C2LC-301
* The Actions panel menu will be implemented in C2LC-140
* The World selector will be implemented in C2LC-290
* Expand and collapse will be implemented in C2LC-292
