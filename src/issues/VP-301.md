The Video Player WordPress plugin naturally requires at least one video source, but the plugin does not yet verify this before allowing the shortcode to be embedded in the document. We need to carry out the validation when the "Insert Into Post" button is pressed and provide appropriate feedback if no source has been provided. We will need to ensure that the dialog remains on-screen if this is the case, and that the rest of the dialog content is preserved.
