These new images should also fix the horizontal scroll issue. I did have to make some changes which was to go back to a single image for the delete button. This will simplify the code. The background should probably be done in css anyways. So we should look into that for the next version.\n"

In the mobile wireframes there is a screen where a use can enter an object code and will be presented with the artifact page for that object. This might be implemented as a component.&#x20;
