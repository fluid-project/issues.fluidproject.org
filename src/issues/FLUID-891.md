The point of the highlight is to help users discover the functionality.  The worst case would be to have a user staring at a screen trying to find the edit link.\n\nFor keyboard interaction, tabbing into the field is when we want the user to know they can edit the information in the field.  Since the field has focus I assume it will display as an editable field at that point?  Perhaps that's enough of an indicator of the ability to edit.  With keyboard interaction what we are missing is the ability to accidentally discover the inline edit option.  I don't think there is a  parallel in keyboard interaction to mouse users randomly moving the mouse around on the screen?  Or perhaps it's just beginning to \"tab around\"?  If editable fields are all changing their display editable then users will get that it's an option.\n\nThoughts?\n"

The wrong focus styling is applied to the in-line edit fields when using keyboard navigation. On mouse over, the in-line edit field is highlighted in yellow. On keyboard navigation, the in-line edit field is only given a dotted border.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the in-line edit demo from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Tap the 'tab' key until one of the in-line edit fields has focus. Notice the dotted border and lack of yellow highlighting
