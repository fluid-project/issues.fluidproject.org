Safari, on the other hand, ignores aria-checked completely and reads out aria-selected.\\\nIE ignores both flags and read the whole content of the videoPlayer div related to <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4748#icft=FLUID-4748>\n"

      "body": "For the first item:\n\nFF + NVDA - For not selected items it tells \"English not selected not checked 1 of 3\"). For the selected item it tells \"English checked 1 of 3\"\\\nIE + NVDA - For any options NVDA will read out the whole videoPlayer content\\\nChrome + NVDA - Chrome refuses to Enter a focus mode by pressing Enter so arrow keys could not get to the language menu\n\nSafari + VoiceOver - For the show captions button it tells \"Show Captions 3 items\". For the not selected item it says \"English/French text\". For the selected item it says \"English/French selected\". Safari is the whole reason why aria-selected was added since aria-checked is being ignored by this browser.\n\nFF + JAWS - You have to enter a Focus mode by pressing Space. For the show captions button it tells \"Show Captions 3 of 3\". For the not selected item it says \"English/French\". For the selected item it says \"English/French checked selected\".\\\nIE + JAWS - Does not say anything\\\nChrome + JAWS - Cannot enter the language menu at all. Most likely because of the conflict in JAWS of space/enter with space/enter keyboard interactions of the language menu\n"
