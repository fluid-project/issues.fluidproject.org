It turns out that Pandoc is not an ideal tool for generating EPUB 3 documents from HTML files. We've decided to switch to a more manual process of building the archive ourselves. This will require the addition of the metadata, manifest, etc. to the repository, and possibly restructuring the repository to facilitate the process.
