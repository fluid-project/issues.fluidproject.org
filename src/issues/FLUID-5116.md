Jess has this error periodically at loading discovery tool:

TypeError: messageResolver is undefined @ <http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/src/shared/lib/infusion/MyInfusion.js:29301>"

Although the error occurs at loading discovery tool, it seems resulted from UIO component. By looking into the code, the fat panel sliding panel is created after the rendering of the iframe without considering whether the message resolver has been created by uiOptions.&#x20;

The solution would be creating an aggregate event that listens to both iframe and UIOptions ready events and having the sliding panel created on this aggregate event.
