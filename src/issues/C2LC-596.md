The initial implementation(s) that introduce the loop blocks do not include hover styles.  The following need hover styles for all themes:

1. The start block in the program editor.
2. The end block in the program editor.
3. The combined "loop" block in the actions panel.
4. The combined "loop" block in the actions simplification menu.
