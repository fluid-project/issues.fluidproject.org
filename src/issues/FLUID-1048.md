Currently, the various simple Reorderer functions (reorderList(), reorderGrid() and reorderLayout()) accept the orderChangedCallback function as a parameter, in addition to the options object.

However, the general convention that has been emerging with our APIs is that required items are parameters to functions, and anything optional is encompassed by the options object.

If we wish for these simple Reorderer functions to be in harmony with this API convention, then the orderChangedCallback parameter should become part of the options object.
