In IE9, I can't seem to get keyboard focus past the Play button most of the time. On first attempt after page load, I can tab to the video player, and to the Play button, but the next press of tab returns focus to the location bar, and subsequent attempts never even focus the video player at all.

Various attempts at clicking in various locations to try to force some kind of focus on the player controls can sometimes work, but not in any reproducible or even remember-able way.
