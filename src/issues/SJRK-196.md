Disable the "Publish my story" button when the story is empty and display a message to the author indicating that they must add content before attempting to publish a story.

This work will effectively disallow the behaviour that was made possible in SJRK-182 and SJRK-183.

Should the tool allow a particular block to be published without having the associated media file present? E.g. an image block with no image specified, but values in the other fields? How about a text block with no content, only a heading?
