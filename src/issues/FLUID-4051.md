I set up a VM with IE6 which didn't have flash on it, and got the no-js basic version of Uploader. Took me a bit to realise it was cos of not having flash - would be nice to have a message that says the plugin is required, or, instead of encouraging flash usage, to switch to an html5 supporting browser.
