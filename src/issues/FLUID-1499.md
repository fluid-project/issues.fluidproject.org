      "body": "Our initial thoughts are that George McFadden should replace Catalina De Silva as a primary persona, because we believe he will be doing more interesting things with dates and timed release than Catalina would, and designing for him would not hurt Catalina's experience because she simply wouldn't be using the Date Picker at all in a variety of contexts. We will have to be sure if we make this change that the date picker doesn't get more complicated and thus Catalina's experience suffers, but as of now we don't know of any use cases which would cause this problem at this point.\n\nWe are also thinking that it might make sense to substitute Andy Wright for Ashley Myles, as it appears Andy is the only one using an online calendar; Ashley uses a paper calendar. We will discuss more on Monday.\n"

Review personas to begin thinking about primary and secondary personas for component.  This will be great prep for a persona stakeholder meeting to identify primary and secondary personas.&#x20;
