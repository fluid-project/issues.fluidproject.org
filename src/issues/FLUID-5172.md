      "body": "This failure was caused by a combination of recent framework work. In particular, the combination of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5089#icft=FLUID-5089> \"fluid.isPlainObject\" and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5127#icft=FLUID-5127> \"compact invokers\" caused a new pathway to be possible where options material supplied to fluid.rawDefaults passed through a new expansion phase operated by fluid.expandCompact. This dispatched to the new \"fluid.isPlainObject\" utility which it turns out is faulty on IE8. On all reasonable browsers, the diagnostic test Object.prototype.toString.call supplied to null and undefined produces special results \"\\[object Null]\" and \"\\[object Undefined]\" respectively. Unfortunately on IE8, both of these tests produce the value \"\\[object Object]\" which is indistinguishable to the return from general objects. This caused configuration of the form\n\nevents: {\\\nevent1: null\\\n}\\\nto become corrupted to \\\nevents: {\\\nevent1: {}\\\n}\n\nby passing through fluid.expandCompact as a result of the unguarded test             if (fluid.isPlainObject(value)) { on line 1806 of FluidIoC.js\n\nThe fix is to add a cheap test for falsy values at the beginning of fluid.isPlainObject\n"

Use IE8 to open up these test files:

Some unit tests fail with the error: Event specification for event with name \[XXX] does not include a base event specification.
