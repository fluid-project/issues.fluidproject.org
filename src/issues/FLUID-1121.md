In all sorts of subtle ways, there arise inconsistencies between the situations where the Reorderer will render a drop target marker, and whether releasing the mouse when this is shown will actually cause a drop to occur there. These typically occur "at the edges" of the range, hence resulting in particular subcases such as FLUID-1055 and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-479#icft=FLUID-479>.
