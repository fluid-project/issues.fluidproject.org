When looking at a search results page, the left sidebar shows a count of the number of resources found in each subject area, etc. The background colour for the actual count number is always white, regardless of the high-contrast theme chosen with UIO. So if the theme is white-on-black, the numbers are invisible, and if it's yellow-on-black, they're practically impossible to see.
