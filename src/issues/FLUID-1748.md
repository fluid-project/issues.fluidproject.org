Springboards: Layout Reorderer example doesn't scroll page when reorderering with the mouse

Steps to reproduce

1\) Open the Layout Reorderer Springboard example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/LayoutReorderer.html>

2\) Decrease the size of the browser window until part of the example 1 is hidden below the fold.

3\) Attempt to drag an item below down the screen

Notice that the page doesn't scroll while dragging.
