In the pull request, the fix appears to be to add the panel by instantiating the \"withMediaPanel\" flavour of UIO.&#x20;\n\nBut how did the Audio + Video tab get there? My only concern is to be sure that ordinary users of UIO don't, by default, see this additional, broken, tab.\n\nCan you take a look and elaborate a bit for me, Anastasia?\n\nThanks!\n"

The media panel is added as a customization of the local UI Options template files (i.e. local to the Video Player), but the changes that were made had not been documented anywhere. I've updated the Infusion README in the lib/infusion folder to include the diffs.\n\nBecause the changes are local to the Video Player integration, they have no effect on anyone else using UI Options. However, it does mean we need to be diligent if the base HTML files are updated.\n"

At some point we lost the audio video panel. I would guess it happened when we upgraded Infusion.&#x20;
