Then, when source\\['orientation'] get called in line 528, it will jump into the last condition at line 548 and passes.  Namely, !fluid.mergePolicyIs(thisPolicy, \"reverse\") will pass because thisPolicy was set to \"undefined\".  This causes the conditional statement to return true, and overwrite the orientation to 1 (which means vertical).  &#x20;\n\nI suspect the condition at line 548 should use \"newPolicy\" instead of \"thisPolicy\", since the variable \"newPolicy\" morphs itself depending on the \"thisPolicy\" type.  I have created a patch to address this, please review. &#x20;\n"

With orientation set to fluid.orientation.HORIZONTAL, using list reorderer, the left panel cannot be dragg-and-dropped to right. The drag-and-drop from the right to left works well though.

A demo site to re-produce the issue:

1\. go to <http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/test/docs/login.php>\
2\. login as demo / demo\
3\. select a course\
4\. The main panel has 2 parts: side menu at left, course home at right. Both panels have light blue bars at the top as grab handles\
5\. drag the left panel and drop to right\
6\. Nothing happens
