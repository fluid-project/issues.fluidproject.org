Currently tooltips are not contextualized. When they are displayed, they do not display with an arrow pointing to the element "owning" the tooltip.

Part of the problem is the jQuery tooltip is being instantiated in a element unrelated to the elements requiring the tooltip.

Consider adding independent tooltips per hoverable element, or consider a new approach.
