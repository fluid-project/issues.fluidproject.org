Implement a sticky simulator so that a user can experiment with sticky keys from within a web interface.

It should be possible to apply the simulator to a text entry field. If a user presses a modifier key, it should be "remembered" and applied to the subsequent keypress in the text entry field.

press modifier once - added to the subsequent character input only\
press modifier twice - added to all subsequent character inputs\
press modifier three times - disables the sticky key

e.g.

* User places focus in a textfield.
* User presses "shift"
* User presses "a"
* The textfield outputs "A"
