As part of the docs work by @jobara for FLUID-6209 on <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/142> we noticed that fluid.dataSource will be a new API for Infusion 3.x so we may as well take the opportunity to backport the version which improves the writable configuration originally written up as KETTLE-49 which was currently only implemented in the FLUID-6580/FLUID-6148 or Infusion 4.x branches to avoid a breaking API change in two successive releases.
