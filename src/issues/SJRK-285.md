If we can configure this in a persistent manner (i.e. along with the site source, or some other associated repo), then I think we're where we want to be.\n\nIf that means setting it in an Ansible playbook that we can use for all Storytelling Tool deployments, that would fit the bill nicely!\n"

In that case it'd make sense to have the max upload size configured there (but it still requires the infrastructure owner to configure all the upstream load balancers to accept it as well).\n\nI think we could leave this JIRA open and amend it to say \"add Nginx\" to docker-compose AND ensure the 2GB limit is set there. WDYT?\n"

Configure the nginxÂ client\_max\_body\_size in the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file in order to make sure we no longer run into issues of deployments with maximum request sizes of 1 MB. Set the value to 2GB.

Whether it is possible to configure this setting in Docker, specifying and checking this setting should be added as a server setup step in README.md

Currently, the docker-compose configuration doesn't have Nginx in front of the Story telling tool. Nginx should be added in a 3-tier app deployment configuration to better mimick what is deployed in production.
