The framework dist build use the "framework" build module. This only includes items that are part of the src/framework/core/. Contextawareness is in its own directory in src/framework and is part of the enhancement module.&#x20;

* <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L268-L271>
* <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/README.md#framework-modules>

Possible solutions:

* move contextawareness into the core directory and clean up the modules to reflect that change
* update the framework dist to use both the core and enhancement modules
