We have temporarily disabled account creation on the ILDH while we work out a database issue. In the meantime, we've decided to have new users simply request an account directly, and we'll manually create it for them.

On the Log In page\
<http://handbook.floeproject.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin>

we'd like a link that says "To obtain a user account, you must request one." where the text "request one" is a "mailto:" link to whoever would be creating new accounts, probably Avtar?&#x20;
