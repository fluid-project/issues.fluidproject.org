For 0.5, we implemented themes as separate code branches (<https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/tree/C2LC-249-space> and <https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/tree/C2LC-249-forest>). In this task, we will move the themes into the main code branch and provide a UI for selecting the theme.
