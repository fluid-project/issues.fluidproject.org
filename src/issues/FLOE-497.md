      "body": "The issue (see attached stack trace) appears to originate in the cleanup process of the IoC testing framework, but I believe it has to do with changes to the core of Infusion. (reason: manually rolled back IoCTestUtils.js to the version from the working commit hash below, and same problem occured).\n\nThis is the last working version of Infusion published to NPM that works: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/a2802dfd9012184984c99f6dd6778e0f14cf7fbe> (2.0.0-dev.20161002T002156Z.a2802df)\n\nThis is the next NPM version in line, where the test begins to fail: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/0bcd507499bf4968630813c25c8146a8163a1e39> (2.0.0-dev.20161027T155641Z.0bcd507)\n"

      "body": "I've isolated the error to changes in the **fluid.instantiator**() function of **fluidIoC.js**, specifically the internal function that.clearComponent() that gets attached to the instantiated component.\n\nFirst isolated by replacing the internal function with the one from the previous working hash locally, at which point the failure at the end of the test go away.\n\nThe specific issue seems to be with whatever behaviour is served by the new destroyRecs options and the new that.clearConcreteComponent() internal function - commenting out the line **fluid.each(options.destroyRecs, that.clearConcreteComponent);** also makes the test failure stop.\n\nI theorize this may be a manifestation of an issue we've seen previously in a different form, which is \"competition\" between Flocking's own clean-up (all of the \"Ignoring call...\" log messages are to Flocking components) and the IoC testing framework's cleanup.&#x20;\n\nAlternately, this may have surfaced an edge case in changes to the IoC functionality, perhaps in its interaction with Flocking.\n"

I've hit my own easy limits of being able to trace Infusion IoC issues.\n\nThis is not an urgent issue because I can pin Chart Authoring to the latest working version of Infusion, but it does prevent me from taking advantage of the new /dist directory from the more recent versions of the NPM package.\n"

Maintenance & anti-entropy for the chart authoring tool:

DEPENDENCY UPDATES:

* update to the official 2.0.0 release of Infusion available via NPM
* update to the latest Flocking, which has some bug fixes
* use the new /dist directory from NPM that contains pre-packaged Infusion

TEST FIXES:

After updating to the 2.0.0 release of Infusion, the Chart Authoring tests are now failing. with a 73rd assertion being run (there are only 72 in the test suite) and "TypeError: shadow is undefined" (FF) / "TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'shadow\.path')" (Safari) / "FluidIoC.js:1046 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'path' of undefined" (Chrome) - this failure is not present in the current master at <http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/tests/html/chartAuthoring-Tests.html> and appears to be because of an issue with the change in Infusion version

In all cases the direct error is line 1046 of FluidIoC.js: <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L1046>

See comments for more exact tracing of the error.
