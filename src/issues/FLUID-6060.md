Steps to reproduce:

1\. Open the [Multiple Versions of Infusion manual test](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/core/multipleVersions/)\
2\. Try to drag items from either Infusion instance.

Notice that they items aren't draggable. This is likely because the touch events are not being translated properly. It's probably that the jQuery Touch Punch plugin is missing from this manual test.
