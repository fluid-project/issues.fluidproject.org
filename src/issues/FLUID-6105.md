      "body": "Accepted proposal from the work list.\n\n1\\. Always keep the version of master set to the next major release number. So, since we've released 2.0.0, master should be set up to publish development releases for 3.0.0. When we eventually cut 3.0.0, it will be incremented to 4.0.0, and so on. The reality is that we know we're going be moving fast and making lots of big changes over the next while as new framework features emerge (such as the new Renderer), so we might as well assume that our next release will be a major one.\n\n2\\. If we do find the need to cut a smaller 2.0.y or a 2.x.y maintenance release due to major bugs or features, we simply do what we've done in the past and use a release branch, apply or back port any fixes we need into this branch when the demand builds up, and then cut a release as needed.\n"

At the moment it is hard to determine what our "next" version of infusion will be. We just tagged Infusion 2.0. Will the next version be 2.0.1, 2.1, or 3.0. In the past we've updated the version number in the repo to reflect the next version. This also has implications for how our dev releases are versioned, via the fluid-publish module; which currently takes the version from the package.json file and appends -dev.xxxxxxxxxxxxx  ( where xxxxxxxxxx refers to the date and commit hash that it was built from ).&#x20;
