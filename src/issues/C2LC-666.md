In the High Contrast theme, the hover and focus styles for a paused loop block are wider than the non-hover/non-focus paused style.

Steps to reproduce:

* Make a program with a loop, such as: startLoopA, forward, endLoopA with 3 iterations
* Use High Contrast theme
* <https://develop-1-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.5&t=contrast&w=Sketchpad&p=sA3s1z&c=abb&d=&s=abb>
* Play the program and pause on the startLoop block
* Hover over the startLoopA block: the block gets wider on hover
* Focus the startLoopA block: the block gets wider on focus
