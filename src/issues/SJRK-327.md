Tab navigation using Safari 13 on MacBook doesn't seem to work on anything other than input fields. On the Edit page, this means that nothing will be given focus unless there are inputs visible on the screen.

**To reproduce:**

1. Navigate to storyEdit.html
2. Press the Tab key

**Expected:**

Focus should move to the first link or button

**Actual:**

\*\*Focus moves to the address bar, and repeated presses of Tab will keep it there
