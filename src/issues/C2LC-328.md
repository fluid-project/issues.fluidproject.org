On Windows, when one clicks in the area of the scrollbar that represents what is not visible, the area with the scrollbar scrolls a little less than one ‘page’ width/height in the direction of the click. On Firefox on Windows, when the scrollbars on the Scene are clicked (both vertical and horizontal) rather than moving a ‘page’ width or height, the Scene moves only a little bit. The Scene scrollbars behave as expected in this regard in Chrome.
