<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5088#icft=FLUID-5088> and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4978#icft=FLUID-4978> provide some measure of resistance to circularity during options expansion. However, there's an important case we haven't tackled - if the material to be expanded is ALREADY circular by the time it is referenced from the options material. This arose in the context of the gpii-express project where the following definition of a dynamic subcomponent:

timeoutResponse: {\
createOnEvent: "onNewTimeoutRequest",\
type:          "gpii.express.tests.requestAware.request",\
options: {\
request:  "{arguments}.0",\
response: "{arguments}.1"\
}\
}

referred via "arguments" to the native express request and response objects. This caused a failure through memory exhaustion. In the browser, we get a "call stack exceeded" messages. This should be detected by a dedicated framework pathway which provides a readable diagnostic.
