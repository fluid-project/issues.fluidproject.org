      "body": "Currently, last empty block is not registered in the 'program' state, and this is causing weird user experience which users have to click the last empty block twice with 'add' function to add an empty block to the end. Design for 0.1 release includes an indicator on the last block as well, so I am wondering if we should include none for the last empty block to the program state.\n"

When the program has exactly same number of commands as the minimum visible steps.\n4. When the program has more commands than the minimum visible steps.\n\nAnd each selectedAction should behave:\n\n* Add from the editor action: indicate all blocks for any of the 4 cases above.\n* Delete from the editor action: don't indicate any blocks for the case 1, indicate up to the last non-empty command for the case 2, indicate up to the steps specified by minimum visible steps, and don't indicate last filled in empty block for the case 3 and indicate all blocks for the case 4.\n* Command from the command panel: indicate all blocks for any of the 4 cases above.\n"
