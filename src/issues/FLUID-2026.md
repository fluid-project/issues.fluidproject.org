Both states of the "Browse File" button show, when page is zoomed (Flash 10)

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open either  the demo or the server version of uploader\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/Uploader.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>

2\) Zoom into the page (Make the font bigger)

3\) Notice that as the zoom increases, you are able to see all states of the "Browse Files" button
