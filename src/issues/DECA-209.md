We are currently working off of Ocropus 0.4.4, which is now quite out of date. I believe it has even been deprecated. The team at the IUPR should know what the latest version is to use. We will probably need a stable tag from ocropus so that we can update our install scripts. The genpdf script will need to be updated too.
