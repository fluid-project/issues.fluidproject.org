Create a server endpoint/route to load the Story Edit page with a given story, which may or may not already be published.

This could be provided via the Story ID in the query string, or perhaps as part of the URL path.

The client-side aspect of this work is covered by <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-410#icft=SJRK-410>.
