Summary on specification with link to more details:

Here's Colin's request:

"I really like this specification page. One request: I find the story cards for each component especially useful. They're helpful in reminding me of the functional requirements in a very succinct and easy to read way. I'd like to see the stories summarized prominently at the top, with a link to more details."
