For video blocks where the video has been added via a URL or embed code, show a preview of the video within the editor both in the block editing screen and in the overall story preview before publishing.

[This page on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16079387/7169781)Â shows a method to achieve this via Markdown alone, or make use of the embedding markup provided by supported video sites.
