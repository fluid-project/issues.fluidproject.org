I'm not 100% sure how the options munging works, but from what I can see, requiring the right-hand-side to be a string is reasonable. If this is true, then the problem lies in the fact that the two full-page version of UI Options do not do this in their config: they have full JS objects.\n"

I am unable to add an 'onSave' listener to uiOptions using the munged options as follows:\
fluid.uiOptions.fullNoPreview("#test", {\
prefix: "yada/yada",\
uiOptions: {\
options: {\
listeners: {\
onSave: function () {\
console.log("onSave event fired");\
}\
}\
}\
}\
});\
The event fires, but it appears that the listener was never registered.

This functionality worked before the FLUID-4409 branch was merged. I tested the project repo immediately before the merge and it worked, and after the merge it didn't.
