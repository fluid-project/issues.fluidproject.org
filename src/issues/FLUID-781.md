Currently, the main example for inline editing is based on the Sakai Announcements tool. This isn't a particularly good example, since editing announcements involves several pieces of text simultaneously. This is a very different type of interaction from the one we've currently got.

We should show a more suitable context for our current style of inline editing, along with realistic markup.

Here are the Inline Edit wireframes and mockups: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/xQAz>
