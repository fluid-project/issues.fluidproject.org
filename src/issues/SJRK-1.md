Master tracking JIRA for prototype storytelling tool implementation.

1\) Implementing the initial UI for the storytelling project as currently expressed in the wireframes at <https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/K1ya8ka55anA7pc#pdfviewer>

2\) Implementing basic persistence and retrieval with Kettle and CouchDB.

End goal is to have prototype working full experience.
