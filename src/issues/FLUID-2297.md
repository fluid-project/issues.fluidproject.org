The Progress component still contains a little bit of code to handle an edge case that we thought that we needed for the Uploader where you could change the container for the object on the fly. This supported a case were you would use one progress indicator for different rows. We changed the architecture of the Uploader to use a progressor for each row (better user feedback) and now that code is just clutter.&#x20;
