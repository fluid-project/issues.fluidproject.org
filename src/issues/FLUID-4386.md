If the fat panel uio is initialized with the table of contents already turned on, the tabs component breaks.

Steps to reproduce

1\) Open the fat panel uio demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FatPanelUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>

2\) Open the uio options and turn on the table of contents, and make sure the changes have saved

3\) Reload the page

4\) Open the uio panel\
Notice that the tabs are now broken
