At the moment, our standalone Image Reorderer example, our documentation, and the default API all suggest that there's a required contract for using prefix:name:suffix-type IDs in the old RSF/Image Gallery style.

This is a complex solution for newcomers, and is entirely unnecessary with the modern Reorderer API. We should do the following:

1\. Create a new standalone demo that takes a lighter approach to markup, without imposing an id-based contract\
2\. Improve the documentation to reflect this\
3\. Delete the obsolete afterMove Callback page located here: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/afterMove+Callback>
