At the moment, InlineEdit requires the user to provide all of the required markup: both a view mode and the form fields for edit mode. It would be very convenient to have an optional mode where the component automatically injects the edit form fields if they aren't already found in the document.

This will ultimately be best achieved with small-scale template rendering on the client, but in the meantime a configurable function that does the DOM manipulation is reasonable.&#x20;
