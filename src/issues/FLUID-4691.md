I have pushed up a version with a fixed framework shim that seems to work for me at \\\n<https://github.com/amb26/infusion/tree/FLUID-4684>\\\nPlease test and let me know how it seems to you.\n"

When using jQuery 1.7.1, if you have tooltips switched on with a RichTextEditor on the page and hover over content, that content will disappear, which means you can no longer edit it.
