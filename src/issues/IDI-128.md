The UI Options theme for Wordpress is using an old version of Infusion. It should be updated to the latest Infusion.

The IDI site uses the wordpress-fss-theme, which should be updated with the latest UIO, or the IDI site should be changed to use the UIO wordpress plugin.

Theme: <https://github.com/inclusive-design/wordpress-fss-theme>

Also the theme should probably be renamed to be specific to UI Options. Calling it "FSS" is confusing.

Note: Floe video player should be changed / removed if it is holding back the UIO update.
