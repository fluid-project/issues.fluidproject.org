In the uPortal example for the Layout Customizer (<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html> ), the avatar does not appear at all when you drag a portlet around. The drop indication does show up, as does the locked portlet warning message, but the avatar itself is invisible.

Could this be a bug related to our opacity setting?
