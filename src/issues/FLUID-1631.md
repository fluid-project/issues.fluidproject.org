Example 1 of the reorderer springboads "Not sortable" elements are also not selectable

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Reorderer Springboards from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/Reorderer.html>

2\) Press the tab key until one of the "I'm Sortable" list items, from example 1, has focus

3\) Using the keyboard attempt to arrow to a "Not Sortable" item

Notice that the "Not sortable" items are also not selectable
