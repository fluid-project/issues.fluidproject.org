The Grid Reorderer locks up on the demo on IE11.

It appears to be limited to IE and I cannot reproduce on FF or Chrome.

To reproduce:

1\. load the demo page demos/reorderer/gridReorderer/\
2\. close the overview panel\
3\. tab to the letter puzzle\
4\. arrow key to "H"\
5\. press CTRL + up and then left to move "H" to the top left, release CTRL\
6\. press CTRL + right and right again

The bottom right square disappears and we see:

F H A\
E B I\
D C

And the component no longer responds to arrow key presses.

It appears to be timing related. If I move slowly it works, if quickly it breaks. Also, if I have the Developer Tools open, I cannot reproduce the problem ðŸ˜ž
