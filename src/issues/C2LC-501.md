Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a program
2. Press the power button to put the ipad to sleep
3. Press the home button to wake it up
4. Play the program

Expected:

* The character makes sounds as it moves

Actual:

* There is no sonification

 

* The only way I’ve been able to get the sonification back once I’ve reached this state is by reloading the page.
* I can add to the program in this state and get the audio descriptions for the addition but playing the program at that point still has no sonification
* If I let it time out to sleep and wake it up immediately the sonification is fine. If I let it time out to sleep and leave it 1 minute and then wake it up there is no sonification

 

Simon was unable to reproduce this issue on the 6th generation iPad running iPadOS 14.8 but can now reproduce after updating to iPadOS 15.0.

The problem still exists in iPadOS 15.0.1

The problem still exists in iPadOS 15.3.1
