As a new user of the framework, we received good feedback from Mike Skirpan, a GSoC student for this year who was working on freely authorable data visualisations. As he got to grips with the documentation and framework primitives, he posted a set of questions and suggestions for improvement in this thread: <http://fluid.2324889.n4.nabble.com/Answers-to-questions-from-Mike-Skirpan-td9615.html>
