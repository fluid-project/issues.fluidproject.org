The framework incorrectly merges invoker records (and possibly listener records as well?) when a user attempts to override an invoker bound to a "funcName" with a "func", or vice versa. Instead, it naively merges them, producing an invoker specification that looks like this:

{\
funcName: "foo.bar",\
func: "{thing}.baz"\
}

It seems like we should either elide the distinction between "func" and "funcName" in the framework, or introduce some special logic that will ensure they are correctly merged.
