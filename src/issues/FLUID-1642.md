Single file upload has identified as a need in the Sakai UX Initiative.  Although single files can be uploaded using the existing upload component we may want a stripped down version that is available in contexts where only single files will be uploaded.

After creating the storyboards, discuss how to proceed with team and create storycards for 0.6 if appropriate.
