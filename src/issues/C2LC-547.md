Observed on NVDA 2021.2 on Windows 10 with Firefox and Chrome.

Steps to reproduce:

* Run NVDA
* Open Weavly in Firefox or Chrome
* Open the Delete Program dialog

Expected:

* What is read will vary by screen reader and platform, but the contents should only be read once.

Actual:

* "delete program dialog, delete button, delete program, button delete"

Notes:

* Similar repeating of content is not heard for the World Selector dialog on NVDA
* The content is not repeated with Chrome and VoiceOver, where the following is spoken: "delete program, dialog, with 4 items, delete, button"
