In Firefox 78, the video block placeholder (when no video is uploaded) is focusable. This should not be the case. The issue does not occur in Chrome 83 or Edge 44 (pre-Chromium).

**To reproduce:**

1. Go to <https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html>
2. Click "Add a video block"
3. One of the following actions
   1. Click on the video preview placeholder
   2. Press "tab" to cycle focus from element to element until it lands on the video preview placeholder

**Expected:**

The placeholder is skipped in tab order

**Actual:**

The placeholder is focusable
