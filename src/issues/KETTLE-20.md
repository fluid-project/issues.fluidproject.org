Kettle's utils.js currently has (line 52):

fluid.pushSoftFailure(function errHandler(args, activity) {\
var messages = args.concat(activity),\
request = fluid.expand("{request}", {\
fetcher: fluid.makeEnvironmentFetcher()\
});\
if (!request) {\
messages = \["ASSERTION FAILED: "].concat(messages);\
console.log.apply(null, messages);\
throw new Error(args\[0]);\
}

we should move the console log outside the request test, since the version of the error logged to the browser is seldom very readable, especially if it includes Objects as part of the logged list. This issue made several error reports we received from GPII universal very hard to read during preparation for the review meeting.
