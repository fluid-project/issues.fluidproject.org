For the case mentioned in the description with font size, the browsers built in zoom will trigger responsive layouts. This isnâ€™t programatically available via javascript in the browser (although UIO+ does take advantage of it through the browser extension apis). There has been some thought to removing this preference in favour of the user just using the browsers built in functionality.\n"

Currently increasing the minimum font size to the maximum makes the user interface of UI Options unusable. It would be good when a user has increased their font size past a particular threshold if we switched simplified layout on. There are probably other settings that could have a similar effect.&#x20;
