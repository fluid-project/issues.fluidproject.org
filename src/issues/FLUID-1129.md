Ask the team to spend some time reviewing the diagram and have a working meeting to discuss, clarify, get feedback, etc. in order to iterate.   We need to have a common understanding and language around it and document the process in a way that makes sense to all of us.

The goals of this meeting are to:\
1\) gain a shared understanding of the diagram & its content \
2\) come out with action items to use the framework to create jiras & show status in wiki

Assume a couple hours for each person on design team (Allison, Eli, Jonathon, Erin, Gary, Paul). &#x20;
