Cannot tab away from the "Browse Files" button with Flash 10; using FF3

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Uploader demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/Uploader.html>

2\) Tap the 'tab' key until the "Browse Files" button has focus.&#x20;

Notice that you are not able to use the keyboard to navigate away from the "Browse Files" button.
