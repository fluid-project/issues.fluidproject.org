When searching from the "Tutorials" or "Components" sub-pages of the Infusion Documentation site, the server returns a 404. It seems this might be a relative pathing issue, as these pages are hosted from subdirectories.

**To reproduce:**

1. Go to the Infusion Docs site: <https://docs.fluidproject.org/>
2. Click on "Tutorials" or "Components" on the top-right of the page
3. Click on one of the topics along the left-side menu (e.g. "Opening Remarks" in Tutorials or "Pager" in Components)
4. Enter a search term in the search bar and hit enter to run the search

**Expected:**

The search results page is displayed with the appropriate results

**Actual:**

The server responds with a 404 error
