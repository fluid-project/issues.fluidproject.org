Per Giovanni Tirloni's recent email about the issues we were having with the OwnCloud instance, we should have a playbook to capture the cert renewal process with Let's Encrypt:

```
Let’s Encrypt was having issues renewing certificates for the past few days. Errors like this:
 
Detail: DNS problem: networking error looking up A for
   files.inclusivedesign.ca
 
Detail: DNS problem: networking error looking up CAA for
   files.inclusivedesign.ca
 
I kept retrying it today until it worked. This is the command that I used:
 
letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d files.inclusivedesign.ca --standalone-supported-challenges http-01 --http-01-port 80 --renew-by-default --email gtirloni@ocadu.ca --agree-tos
 
It would be great to somehow have this in Ansible but I haven’t had the time to focus on this yet.
```
