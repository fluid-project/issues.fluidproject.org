Currently, calculating whether the mouse is positioned "before" or "after" the drop target during drag-and-drop is handled by the Reorderer itself â€“ see trackMouseMovement() and beforeOrAfter(). This responsibility should be moved to the layouthandler since it is in a better position to know what "before" or "after" means.
