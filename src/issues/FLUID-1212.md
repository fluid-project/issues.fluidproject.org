Identify likely places the component will live, 'contexts-of-use' (COU), in Fluid partner applications.  We don't need to document every potential COU but rather want to identify the most likely places it will live and capturing a diverse group.  Think of the 80/20 rule here.

COUs should be documented on the wiki in the component space with screen shots and descriptions. &#x20;

This is a first pass at documenting known potential COUs.  This activity will continue to be iterated on we work through the design process, meeting with interested parties and the such.
