In my own work, I created a transform function that allows you to perform a single transformation on every element in an array:

<https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/ul-api/blob/UL-65/src/js/client/transformArray.js>

As I will be working on submitting other transformation functions, I wanted to create this and ask Antranig Basman if he'd like to see this as well.  "hell no" and "not yet" are perfectly acceptable answers.
