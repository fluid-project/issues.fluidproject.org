To replicate:

1\. Browse to <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/demo.html>\
2\. Go into edit mode for the text under CKEditor 3\
3\. Paste in the following character repeatedly, anywhere in the editable area: â˜€

(in Safari 4/OS X 10.5, it sometimes erases all the text if the user pastes repeatedly; in IE 8, FF 3.6/XP, the character sometimes appears at the end of line momentarily, but then disappears)
