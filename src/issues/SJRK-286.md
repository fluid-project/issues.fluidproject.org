We'd need to verify what is stored on the server, but from what I understand is that many browsers do not use the orientation information from the exif data. Firefox currently supports the[image-orientation CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-orientation), which you can set to `from-image`. I actually added this to the upload preview but forgot to check it for the story viewer. <https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/themes/base/css/storyTelling.css#L279>\n\nHere is some more information from stack overflow: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/42428659>\n"

Some images are being uploaded with incorrect orientation, even though such metadata likely exists in the image file.

**To reproduce**:

* find a JPEG image with EXIF data containing an orientation value other than 1
* if you're running from the pull request branch (<https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/50>), you can refer to the test images in the "tests\testData" directory
* add a new image block and upload that image

**Expected**: the image will be the correct orientation that matches what is seen in the Finder upload dialog or on the mobile device (see attached screenshot "working")

**Actual**: the image is rotated 90 or 180 degrees and looks incorrect (see attached screenshot "not working")

The image will have the incorrect orientation both in the story editor preview as well as in the published story
