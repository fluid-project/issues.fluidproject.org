      "body": "Below are notes on screen reader pronunciation of \"Türkiye\".\n\n# Chrome with NVDA on Windows 10\n\nWith the Microsoft OneCore voices (default), all 5 of the voices that NVDA offered (US and Canadian voices: David, Linda, Zira, Mark, Richard) pronounced \"Türkiye\" as \"Turkey\".\n\n# ChomeVox on ChromeOS 108\n\nThe 8 Chrome OS US English voices consistently pronounced \"Türkiye\" as \"tur-key-eh\".\n\n# Safari with VoiceOver on MacOS 12.6.2\n\nI experienced more variability in pronunciation on Mac. The English US voices pronounced \"Türkiye\" sometimes like \"turk-o-why-ee\" (Alex) and sometimes like \"turkey-eye\" (Nicky).\n\n \n"
