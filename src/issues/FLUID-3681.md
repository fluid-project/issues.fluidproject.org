It is now time to begin work on the other, more long-term approach to composition of renderer-bearing components (now that work from FLUID-3658 work on protocomponents is merged in). This involved exposing what were called "renderer antigens", being, "statically determinable renderer lifecycle points" from a component in its position in a complex component tree. At the very least, these allow the component to report the location of templates it requires, have these templates delivered to it (asynchronously) and then enter a further lifecycle point where the renderer is invoked and the component bound to markup. It is necessary therefore for the component to exist at at least 3 distinct lifecycle points. The configuration and location of elements such as the renderer, templates, renderer options, applier and model will become stereotypical and operated by a standard construction cycle.
