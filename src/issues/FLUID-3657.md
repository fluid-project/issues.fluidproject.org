If the component tree for a select uses full IDs for the parent references instead of relative IDs (i.e. uses "parentFullID" instead of "parentRelativeID"), the renderer calls "getAbsoluteComponent()" instead of "getRelativeComponent()" (see fluidRenderer.js, line 753 in v1.2). Unfortunately, the function "getAbsoluteComponent()" does not exist.
