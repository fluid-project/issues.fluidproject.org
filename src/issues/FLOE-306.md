Add tooltips for yes and no buttons on the speak text panel.

The speak text adjuster has not implemented tooltips for its controls. The solution may not be as simple as adding the gpii.firstDiscovery.attachTooltip grade. This is because the buttons used to control the smaller and larger buttons are generated by renderer. Currently a tooltipContentMap is supplied to identify which selectors are associated with which text, but there are no distinct selectors supplied for the individual buttons.
