System is forgiving and is able to recognize vocalizations that are not very clear.&#x20;

* Ability to map speech sounds to specific actions&#x20;
* Providing suggestions for word approximation and babbling&#x20;

 

Details from the co-design:

"Splatter Painting" - Different ways of interacting with the system include Vocalization: word approximation, babbling, early speech sounds

 

Might want to do low-fi development experiments

We can test this with speech to text commands that Daniel has developed
