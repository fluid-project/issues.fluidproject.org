So, I'm not sure how it happened, but svn has become VERY messy, and with patches not going in, being created on very old revisions, AND some patches just having small mistakes - the svn needed some cleaning.

Here is a patch that fixes a few small things.

a) curvycorners.js was not included into the header and the .js file itself was not uploaded\
b) missing images - background images, new logo images, etc, were not uploaded when we added johnc's redesign\
c) the signup page is a MESS, and I am reverting it back to the original, and will patch it again once the system itself is cleaned up.

Here we go! first step out of the darkness and confusion
