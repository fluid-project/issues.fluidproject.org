* Set up a Dockerfile for the server project (sjrk-story-telling-server)
* Determine how to get a CouchDB container set up using fluid-couch-config
* Add whatever configurability is needed to allow us to wire containers together, perhaps withÂ <https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-launcher>
* Set up a Docker Compose file which brings together all of the containers required to host the Storytelling Tool
