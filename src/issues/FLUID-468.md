At the moment, the Fluid Portal Layout Manager doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, and conflicts with the concept of a layout manager within uPortal.

We also want to brand the Fluid release bundle with its own name to disambiguate it from other Fluid-named products such as the Mac OS X application of the same name.
