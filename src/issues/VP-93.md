In IE8, using the keyboard to mute and unmute pushes focus onto Transcripts. In other browsers, mute and unmute using keyboard maintains focus on the volume button.

To reproduce:

* In IE8 load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Tab focus Volume button
* Press Enter
* Notice focus is pushed onto Transcripts and opens the Transcripts menu.
