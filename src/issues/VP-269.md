Setting the language preference for transcripts through UIO will bring up the correct language, but the drop down language selector has the wrong language.

Steps to reproduce

1\) In UIO set the transcripts to on, and pick french as the desired language.

2\) close UIO and refresh the page.

3\) notice that the transcripts are in French, but the drop down says it is English
