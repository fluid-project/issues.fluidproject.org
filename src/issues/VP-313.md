The Captions and Transcripts menus currently contain a "Show/Hide" item that acts as an on/off button, independent of the currently selected language (selecting a language also shows).

The designs call for a different interface:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+video+player+mockups+%28final%29>

The menus should have a "No caption" item that functions  more like a radio button with the languages: If "No caption" is selected, then no language is selected at all. The only way to actually show a caption is to select a language. Captions are hidden by selecting "No captions."

Regarding interaction with UIO Preference:

If a UIO preference for a particular language has been specified, then that language should be selected. If that language is not available in the menu, then "No captions" should be selected.

In the case of transcripts, if UIO has been used to turn transcripts on, but the selected language is not available, "No transcripts" should be selected, and the transcripts window should not be visible.
