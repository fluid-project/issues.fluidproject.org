Better, but suddenly <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2334#icft=FLUID-2334>, which before I'd only seen in the demo version started happening in the server version.&#x20;\n\nSo what's happening is interesting. In both cases, bugs are being caused by SWFUpload's insistence on refreshing the Flash object on the page if anything in it's DOM ancestry changes.&#x20;\n\nIn the case of this crash, we get a funny race condition that crashes FF or occasionally hangs SWFUpload (not unlike the Pause bug by the way).\n\nIn the case of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2334#icft=FLUID-2334>, we get recycled file ids because the refreshed Flash object doesn't remember that it had already used that id.&#x20;\n\nThis gives me a little insight on how to fix the bug... move the button out of the DOM ancestry... wonky... but it might work. Or I could move the styling for the total progress bar out of the ancestry, that might work as well.\n\nAnyway, I should have noticed a while back that when I commented out the feature to stop the crash, the other bug (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-2334#icft=FLUID-2334>) stopped happening.\n\nSorry for the ramble, but it's that kind of a bug!&#x20;\n"

May be just a fluke with my server but I can consistently crash FF3 running the Uploader from my local server. This is revision 6621. Revision 6566 on builds.fluidproject.org does not display the same behavior.

Lets see:\
Server version only\
Flash 10\
Firefox 3 (I tried disabling all my add-ons, no luck)

The reproducible steps are: \
1\. Click Browse Files\
2\. Add a few files to the queue\
3\. Click Upload\
4\. Let all files complete\
5\. Click Browse Files again\
6\. Add a few files\
7\. Click Upload

Result: FF immediately exits
