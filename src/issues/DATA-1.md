Review comment <https://github.com/inclusive-design/forgiving-data/pull/1#discussion_r605298102>Â on the initial forgiving-data pull request noted that the implementation could be improved to join on a compound column rather than a single best choice. A related improvement would be to present the user with a ranked list of choices for a join rather than a single best choice.
