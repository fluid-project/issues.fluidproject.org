When the user tabs to the video, Jaws does not automatically switch into application mode. This means that not all keystrokes are directed to the player, but some are intercepted by Jaws (e.g. the up/down arrows on the scrub bar, the volume slider, the captions and transcripts menu).

The ARIA 'application' role is supposed to automatically trigger this change; we're using it, but it's not happening. It's possible we're not putting the role on the right element, i.e. the element that's getting focus?
