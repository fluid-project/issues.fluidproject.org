Discussions in the Fluid IRC channel on May 2, 2008 ( <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/NYsk> ) led to a new understanding of the purpose of the ARIA 'activedescendant' property, and the fact that it may not be appropriate for our purposes: it seems to be intended for the case where focus is **not** being put on to the descendant of a container (focus stays on the container itself), so you need a property to tell you which descendant is active. We **do** put focus on the descendant, and we already have another way of keeping track of which one is active, so we may simply not need it.

We should double-check the spec and the best practice guide, and decide whether or not to remove this property.
