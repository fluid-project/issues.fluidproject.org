Somehow VoiceOver on MacOS reads the title of the modal when the privacy modal opens up, but I realized that’s not the case for VoiceOver on iPad, or NVDA on windows. Our custom modal component has optional properties for aria-label and aria-labelledby, so we should set one of them to fix this issue.
