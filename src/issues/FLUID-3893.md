In firefox, go to preferences, advanced, and check "always use the cursor keys to navigate" under accessibility preferences.

In list reorderer demo (<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/listReorderer/>) tab to the list, then move down arrow to item #4, use right arrow all the way to the end. This breaks the reorderer until you hit tab again. There are variations of cursor movement that also break it.... would take time to figure out what exactly is affecting it.
