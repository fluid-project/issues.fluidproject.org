Add markup to the ProgramBlockEditor to ensure that the Robot character is perceivable by screen reader. Make it into a heading so that it is part of the page structure. Something along the lines of:

```java
<h3>
    <span role='img' aria-label='robot character'>
        <RobotIcon/>
    </span>
</h3>
```

Notes:

* Retrieve the "robot character" string from the localized messages file
* Verify that the image is perceivable by screen reader
