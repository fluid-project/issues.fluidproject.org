Details:

* Currently successfully uploaded files are green to match the success checkmark and the green bar indicator.  We would like the files and size to look unactionable by being grayed out.   Perhaps a green grey would work?  We need a better distinction between those uploaded and those still in the queue (particularly in an "add more" scenario).
