Suggested by Ari that we should have keyboard shortcuts for all the items in the control panel.

We will make the following changes:

* Make changes to the Replace button in the control panel
  * Remove the replacement focus cycle: the Replace button always does replacement (if there is a selection)
  * The Replace button is enabled when there is a selected action and disabled if there is no selected action
  * We make the replacement and announce it even when the selected action is the same as the current block
  * We keep the current behaviour of not showing the Replace button in the control panel for loop blocks
* Add a Replace keyboard shortcut
  * Ctrl + Alt + c&#x20;
  * If there is no selected action: announce "no action selected"
  * If the current program step is a loop block: announce "replace is not available for loops"
  * Otherwise: make the replacement and announce the replacement, even if it is the same action

Additionally, we will add the following announcements for the movement shortcut:

* Add an announcement whenever movement isn't possible
  * "At the end of the program, unable to move right"
  * "At the beginning of the program, unable to move left"
