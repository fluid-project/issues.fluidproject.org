Each block has a field called "section title", but these might more accurately be called "section heading", especially since we have a “Title” field on the second page of the editor.

Additionally, the block selection checkbox is labeled "Select this section", while the delete button is labeled “Remove selected blocks”. Terminology should be used consistently throughout the site (i.e. either "block" or "section" but not both).
