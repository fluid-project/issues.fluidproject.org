We have new descriptive text about the IDI for the site. Discussions with Joanna resulted in the following plan:

* rename the current "About" page to "People"
* reduce the scope of the text at the top of the new "People" page to something more appropriate (perhaps only the paragraph about community), depending on the new content
* new content goes in "About"
* new About page has headings in left sidebar
* new About page has "What is Inclusive design" (only) in right sidebar
* new People page has institution list and contact info in right sidebar
