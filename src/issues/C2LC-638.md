Steps to reproduce:

* Focus a start loop block
* Press Enter to open the control panel
* Press Tab, focus moves to the iteration input control
* Press Tab again

Expected:

* Focus to go into the control panel

Actual:

* Focus goes to the following add node

Cause: the iteration input control is not specified for the control panel focus trap.
