The licence for the Storytelling tool should only be the New BSD Licence (aka 3-clause), according to the guidelines for new projects here: <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Licensing>

Remove references to ECL in both projects so that only the BSD licence text is present, paying attention to the grammar.
