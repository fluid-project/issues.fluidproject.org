The renderer has historically supported the construction where the fields for a UIMessage may themselves be a UIBound - for example in the form\
{messagekey: {\
valuebinding: "reference.to.key.in.model"\
}}\
which allows the resolution of an I18N message to be geared through a model. However, there is a "fault" in the implementation of the protocomponent expander, that it is not possible to take advantage of this facility by means of writing a UIMessage protocomponent with EL reference that expands to this form - for example the following construction\
{messagekey: "${reference.to.key.in.model}"} \
fails to expand properly (although "args") are expanded. This patch corrects the protocomponent expander so that the messagekey member of UIMessage is expanded as if it were a UIBound.
