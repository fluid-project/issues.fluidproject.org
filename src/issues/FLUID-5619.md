Based on feedback:

* &#x20;get a highlight on the "current section" link in the upper right corner? i.e. if we're looking at the tutorials, the link "Tutorials" should be highlighted?
* Looking at the Tutorials section table of contents, the various line spacings make it difficult to distinguish one multi-line link from another; the different line spacings seem too similar to each other. Could we reduce the line spacing in a single link?
* Links in the table of contents are bold, but they're not in the designs.
* make the footer text a little bit smaller?
