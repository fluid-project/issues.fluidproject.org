The Selection Reader component of the Orator does not read text in certain cases

**To reproduce:**

1. Go toÂ <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/>
2. Click and hold with the mouse to select any part of the left-side panel's title to the beginning of the word "Orator" below, but not any part of the word "Orator" itself (see the attached screenshot "2020-07-16 Orator not reading bug 1.png" for an example of this)
3. Click "PLAY"

**Expected:**

The Selection Reader should read all of the selected text aloud and the button should change to "STOP" while it's reading

**Actual:**

The Selection Reader does not read anything and the button stays the same
