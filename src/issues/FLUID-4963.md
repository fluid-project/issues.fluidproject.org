In Firefox and IE9, when the tab key is used to tab through the controls in the new panels, tabbing to panels that are 'off-screen' to the right does not properly auto-scroll those panels into view. When focus arrives on the 'emphasize links' checkboxes, those boxes scroll into view (but not their associated labels), but that's it.

Note that in Chrome and Safari, this is NOT a problem: controls scroll into view adequately.
