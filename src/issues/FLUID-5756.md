Currently the mockTTS lives in the test directory for the TextToSpeech component. However, for integrators using a custom build of Infusion including the TextToSpeech component, they will not have access to the mockTTS for using in their tests. It should instead be moved to the TextToSpeech's source directory so that it will passed along with the build.
