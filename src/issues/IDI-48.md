Designer review of the Infrastructure page resulted in the following requested changes:

* get rid of images for now (including sketches) (in the future: images changed to rectangular, with borders as in single-article mock-up)
* move chevron closer to book-it&#x20;
* make 'book it' links same colour as 'coming soon' (both of which should be a smidge darker)&#x20;
* more spacing between columns (roughly double)
