Do: Mouse-over some inline editable text, and click.\
Observe: The insertion point is put at the beginning of the editable field.

Do: Using the keyboard, tab to the editable text, and press Enter (or spacebar).\
Observe: The insertion point is put at the end of the editable field.

I believe that the current design specification currently says that the default should be the end of the text.
