I was looking into [SNOW-39](https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/SNOW/issues/SNOW-39?filter=allopenissues) and it appears to be a caching issue. I tried installing the Super Cache plugin (<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)> but it failed upon install. It appears there are insufficient privs.

See: <https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpsupercache>

Now the PHP error is appearing on all pages. I have put up a Maintenance message on the site for now.

What would be the ideal solution in this case? Should we grant specific permissions this case only, or should we find another solution?
