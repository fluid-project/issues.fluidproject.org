While moving an avatar quickly, the pointer will appear as an arrow instead of a hand.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Sortable JQuery Tabs Demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/jquery-tabs/jquery-tabs.html>

2\) Drag one of the Tabs. Notice that while you quickly move the mouse, the pointer changes to an arrow
