The Components page on the wiki\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Components>\
has several instance of the "Image not Available" icon (it is actually missing some members of the Reorderer family, too). It would be nice if we could create nice images for:

UI Options

* taken from the wireframes at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options+Wireframes>?
* using the controls on the left side of the pages

UI Enhancer

* taken from the wireframes at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options+Wireframes>?
* maybe using the enlarged preview partway down the screen
* or use the example at <http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/portal/portal.html> with the high-contrast skin applied?

List Reorderer -&#x20;

* taken from <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/standalone-demos/reorderer/html/sortable-styled-todo-list.html>

Grid Reorderer -&#x20;

* taken from the fridge-magnet-poetry section of <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/standalone-demos/quick-start-examples/reorderer/html/LayoutReorderer.html>

Reorderer (in general)? (or just re-use another one?)

* taken from ???
