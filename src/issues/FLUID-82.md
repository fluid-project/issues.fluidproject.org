The tabs for uPortal mockup needs to have all it's links disabled and not look like links.

These include:

* login
* Maximize
* links on the tabs
* links in list on the first page
  * Contents
  * Whence Came This Tab?
  * Whence Came DLM?
  * Introducing dlm.xml
  * Defining Framents
  * Defining Audiences
  * Setting up Fragment Layouts
  * Custom UI Changes
  * Future Direction

-
  * for user testing at the JA-Sig UCamp we don't want the user to navigate away from the page.

Thanks a lot.

Barbara
