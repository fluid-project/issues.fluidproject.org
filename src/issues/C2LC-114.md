If Dash is turned off after the connection dialog appear and the user tries to pair it, the UI looks like it is trying to connect to Dash indefinately.

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Click Connect to Dash, but do not pairÂ 
* Turn off Dash
* Press pair to Dash

Expected: Try to connect to dash, but fails to connect

Actual: Status mark will spin forever
