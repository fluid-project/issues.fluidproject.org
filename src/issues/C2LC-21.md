Modify the Interpreter to be able to run programs with Custom Commands.

Rename the existing `Program` type to `CommandSequence` and add a new `Project` type that includes Custom Commands:

```java
export type CommandSequence = Array<string>;
export type Project = {
    customCommands: {
        [command: string]: CommandSequence
    },
    program: CommandSequence
};
```

Example project:

```java
{
    customCommands: {
        square: ["forward", "left", "forward", "left", "forward", "left", "forward"]
    },
    program: ["square", "square"]
}
```

Test cases:

* Project with empty `program` and empty `customCommands`
* Project with `program` command sequence but no `customCommands`
* Project with `program` and `customCommands`
* Program with undefined commands (no registered command handlers or custom commands)
* Redefinition of built-in commands (command handlers)
* Recursion

See the discussion of command redefinition and recursion at <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Custom+Blocks>

We should also rename our existing editors to `CommandSequence...Editor` rather than `Program...Editor` as they operate on command sequences in our new model.
