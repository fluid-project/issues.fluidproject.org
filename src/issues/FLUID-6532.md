The UIO panel is aligned to the left of the screen and it would look better if it was centred. At yesterday's We Count check-in [Lisa Liskovoi](https://issues.fluidproject.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=lliskovoi) and Uttara confirmed centring the UIO panel would look best. You can not see the error clearly on screen sizes with a smaller width but with a screen width greater than 3000px it becomes obvious.

To reproduce this issue:

1. Go to <https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/>
2. Inspect page in responsive view
3. Click on the UIO tab at the top of the webpage (it has the text + show preference)
4. Edit the screen width to be greater than 3500px.
5. View error - UIO panel is aligned to the left of the screen

Screenshots of the effects before and after correcting the error are attached below. The first image marked with a red rectangle is before the change. The second image is after applying the proper corrections.
