This appeared in some work on the metadata component discussed on IRC at <https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/msg/14144056/> (2/5/14 at 1.07pm).\
It seems as if it would be helpful if there is no other specification of an input, to assume that inputPath: "" was meant.\
This would be very simple to implement but as usual with MT we need to think hard to ensure that this doesn't have any unexpected and unpleasant consequences in some scenario.
