When the nav bar is stuck to the top of the window, it covers content that is active, e.g. internal anchors such as people on the People page (click a name, and the person jumps to the top, under the sticky nav), or if you tab backward from the bottom of the page the things you tab to i.e. things which have focus will be under the sticky nav.
