The Learning Dashboard prototype in the repository at <https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-455> contains demonstration of many desired behaviours of an application based on the MyL3 toolkit, including the "day by day" journal aspect and the recording and annotation of UIO preference changes.

As refactored components become available, the Learning Dashboard demo should be reimplemented using them, both as a means of keeping the demo up to date and as a guide towards needed additional functionality.
