Port 2514 is used by the RELP protocol and syslog cannot bind to it when SELinux is enabled in enforcing mode.

Our log servers are running in permissive mode and this needs to be fixed.&#x20;

Port 2514 is suggested by the documentation but it's not a standard port so Red Hat refused to add it to the list of syslog ports.
