Currently, we track "enabled" actions, which results in issues like C2LC-589, where old URLs do not contain the new looping actions, and are implicitly disallowed.

This work flips the paradigm and tracks only the actions that are disallowed.

This is a breaking change, the previous syntax will be ignored and we will use a new keyword/letter for local storage/URL persistence.  The tests should confirm that the old syntax is ignored and does not cause any problems.
