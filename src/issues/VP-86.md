Enabling captions causes native video controls to appear. Thus causes two control bars to be visibly overlapping when mouse is hovered over the video player. This only appears to happen during the initial reveal of captions. Any subsequent hide/show of captions does not cause native controls to appear.

Playing the video causes native control to disappear.
