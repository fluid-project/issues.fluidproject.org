According to the Decapod 0.3 Design wireframes (<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod+0.3+Design>), there are some changes needed in the workflow related to image capturing:

1\. Before first capture cameras should be detected. If less than 2 supported cameras are detected, the Detect Camera dialog should be displayed.\
2\. After first capture, Page order dialog should be displayed.\
3\. After each capture, post-processing should be run in the background (currently crop & stitch).
