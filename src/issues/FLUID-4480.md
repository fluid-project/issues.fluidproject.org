This error occurs using the Image Gallery server demo, not the simpler demo.

In IE, if you remove a file from the uploader queue, an error message appears:

HTTP Status code: File cancelled.\
\<file> failed to upload

where \<file> is the file removed from the queue. The Uploader seems to function just fine: the file is removed from the queue, and you can continue to add files, upload, etc. You just get this message.
