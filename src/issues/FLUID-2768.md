Description: I've found that when using flc-pager-summary, flc-pager-page-size, flc-pager-previous, flc-pager-links, and flc-pager-next, the first 2 work fine when not surrounded by a flc-pager-top (or bottom), but that previous, links, and next do not.  Which was a bit mysterious and took a while to figure out what was wrong.

Expected Behavior:  I'm not sure what the expected behavior should be.  I think it would make a lot of sense to be able to have 1 copy of all of these operate somewhere inside the paged area but not inside a designated pager-top|bottom.

Or maybe summary and page-size are supposed to be available everywhere and this is actually working as designed.
