As per discussion in Fluid Technology on 18/1/21 - it would be helpful if the principally advertised configuration for fluid-json-schema just validated a component's model, dealing with the use case of validating submitted user input. The grade which validates a component's entire options should be a separate piece of machinery which can be opted in to.
