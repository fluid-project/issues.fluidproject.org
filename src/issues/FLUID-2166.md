Currently, specific WAI-ARIA information is being recorded under Accessibility in the pattern. This kind of information is very specific and more implementation oriented (vs. interaction oriented which is typical of a design pattern).

Task:\
Investigate how the OSDPL should handle this kind of information.

Questions:

* should we guide users to not input specific / implementation details in creating a pattern?
* should we create space on the OSDPL to accomodate this kind of information?
* what would the interaction be like on the OSDPL (how do we relate implementation to patterns? how can this content be created?).
