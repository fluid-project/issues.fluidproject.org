If the invitation text is different than the default \"Click here to edit,\" then you would have to type the different text to see this bug. You can try this on the manual test page:\\\n<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/tests/fluid-tests/manual/inline-edit/InlineEdit.html>\n\nThe problem is caused by the way the inline edit decides whether or not the field contains text that the user typed, or the invitation text. It compares the text to the invitation text, and if they are the same, it assumes that the invitation text is there because the user left the field empty.\n"

If you edit an inline edit field with the  text "Click here to edit" it is equivalent to deleting all of the content of the field.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open one of the inline edit demos from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Edit the text of one of the inline edit fields to "Click here to edit"

3\) Click the inline edit field again and notice that there is no text displayed.&#x20;
