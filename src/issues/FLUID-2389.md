Lower the maximum, minimum text size, so that the page is still usable and readable

Currently, when the minimum text size is set to 200, it is no longer readable, nor usable. \
Somewhere from 30 - 40pt would likely be the maximum that it should currently be able to go.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html#>

2\) Open the UI Options dialog

3\) Change the font to the maximum size.

Notice that it is no longer usable nor readable
