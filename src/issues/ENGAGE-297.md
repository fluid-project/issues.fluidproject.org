      "body": "The one change in this patch that seems a little odd is the format of the json data files and therefore the expectation of initComponentWithLocalData. The data files now contain an options block rather then just a model. Yura explained that the reason he made that change was because the exhibition view requires a model for the guestbook sub component. This model needs to be specified as part of the exhibition view options not as part of the exhibition view model. If we don't change the expectations of  initComponentWithLocalData then we would need to put demo data into the options we pass to it. This defeats the purpose of separating out the demo data from the html file. &#x20;\n"

Some of the components seem to no longer work when looked at locally from the file system. It's best for components to be able to be worked on without a web server present.&#x20;
