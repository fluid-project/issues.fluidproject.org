UI Options: when navigating with the keyboard, you can't tab out of the slider.

Steps to reproduce:

1\. Open up the UI Options demo at <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/demo.html>\
2\. Click the "Edit Appearance" button\
3\. Tab four times to get focus on the first jQuery UI Slider ("Maximum text size")\
4\. Try to move focus off the slider using Tab or Shift-Tab. Neither work.

This issue affects all non-mouse users of UI Options, and so qualifies as a blocker.
