**Activities**

Hold the first two co-design sessions with learners and educators to determine the scope and features of the new programming environment's core coding functionality and project persistence

Implement core coding functionality in the new programming environment (such as sequencing of actions and repeating sequences)

Continue technical exploration of connection to existing programming environments started in milestone 1

Begin creation of teaching resources, guides, tutorials, and activities for the new programming environment

Recruit adults with disabilities to participate in early co-design sessions and to help establish a coding mentorship and training program.

Update the co-design kit for session to be held in Milestone #3

Â 

**Expected Outcomes**

The first two co-design sessions have been completed and a summary published to the project website. Results of co-design will form the basis of the specific functionality designed.

Software release of programming environment with core coding functionality.
