      "body": "Let's talk to Sepi about this. Argument for not fixing: the users most likely to be using the action selection shortcuts are users of external ATs, such as Grid 3, and in this case there is no notification that an action is hidden to the AT. The connection is one-direction only, sending of shortcuts. So, when an action is hidden in the Weavly UI, it will continue to be visible in a custom keyboard. And maybe it is better for the selection shortcut to continue to work.\n"

Currently, keyboard shortcuts can be used to select actions that have been "hidden" using the actions simplification menu.Â  This ticket will change that behaviour so that the action is only selected if it's available for use.
