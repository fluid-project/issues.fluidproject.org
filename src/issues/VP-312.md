The WordPress plugin admin page sets the value of the 'prefix' used by UIO to find templates, etc. (Eventually, plugin users may want to override it). Currently, the shortcode processing doesn't have any default for the prefix, so if the plugin admin page hasn't been visited AND SAVED, then the prefix is not set and UIO can't find the templates.
