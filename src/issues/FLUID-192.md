In the simple case, the caller can pass a single function named 'findMovables' which will identify items that are selectable, movable and drop targets. If more control is required, such as in the portlet reordering case, the caller can pass the following structure:\n\nfindItems: {\\\nselectables: function () {},\\\nmovables: function () {},\\\ndropTargets: function () {}\\\n}&#x20;\n"

Currently the Reorderer has the concept of an "orderable" element, which implies that these elements are simultaneously selectable, movable, and can serve as drop targets for other orderables.

In order to support the complex use cases of portlet reordering, we need to identify each of these types of elements separately. As a result, we need to modify the Reorderer's API to take in the following parameters:

{\
selectables: jQ || \[],\
movables: jQ || \[],\
dropTargets: jQ || \[]\
}

This will replace the concept of orderables completely.
