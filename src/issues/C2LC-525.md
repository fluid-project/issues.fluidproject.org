Safari on iOS seems to not support column-gap/row-gap if display type is not grid. Currently, the footer's display is set to flex, and it's changed to grid, it is fixed.

Few other places in Weavly, where we used either column-gap or row-gap with display: flex, and as you can see in the screenshot, the title image and the heading doesn't have any gap in between, as well as the selection radio button and the labels.\

Issue is visible on iPadOS 14.4\
Doesn't seem to be an issue on iPadOS 15.\

Could be, although it looks like it should have been supported. Or maybe it was something about the particular usage or other property.
