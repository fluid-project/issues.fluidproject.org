However, it is unclear how this will work with CCK and our organic workflow (i.e. may not allow the user to jump randomly through the process).\\\n<http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/06/30/hooray-figured-out-drupal-5-multi-step-registration-form-with-validation-and-invites/>\n"

Currently the CCK form used for creating Design Pattern content types is very long. It presents a usability concern and may discourage users from contributing their patterns.

We should investigate ways to create a multi-step form (in CCK or not) so we can break apart the form.
