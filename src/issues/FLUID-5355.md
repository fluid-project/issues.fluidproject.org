It appears that Chrome throws an error as soon as the resource is inaccessible, preventing our error event pipeline from triggering.\n\nIs it enough to have this working just in Firefox? (only firefox and chrome support the TTS enactor).\n"

The climate change demo's text-to-speech feature requires access to a server hosted at the IDRC. The demo should ensure to handle the case where the server is down or otherwise inaccessible (e.g. running locally without internet access).&#x20;
