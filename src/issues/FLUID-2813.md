---
1\. Add text prior to breadcrumbs: "You are here"\
Can be hidden text. See: <http://www.webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/>

2\. Also using greater than symbol (" Home > About " ) reads literally as "Home greater than About" with a screen reader. Could try using colon instead, e.g: Home: About:&#x20;

Another possibility could be using an image of the greater than symbol that had a title attribute of some sort. &#x20;
