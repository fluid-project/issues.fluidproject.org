GitHub provides the option of adding contributor guidelines ( <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/> ) to the repository. These guidelines are linked to when a PR is submitted.

Currently these guidelines are captured on the fluid-wiki at:

* <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Contributing+Code>
* <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Contributing+to+a+Fluid+Component>
* <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Contributing+Code+To+Infusion>
* <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards>
