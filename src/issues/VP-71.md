At the moment, the Video Player uses an incorrect check to determine HTML 5 video support in the browser. As a result, browsers with some preliminary HTML 5 support (such as Safar 3.2) will show the video controller even when the browser has actually gracefully degraded.

This should be fixed by following Mark Pilgrim's guidelines in Dive into HTML 5:
