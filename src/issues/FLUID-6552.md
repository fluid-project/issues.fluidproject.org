Currently all enactor CSS styles are compiled into a single Enactors.css file from Enactors.styl However, if an instance of the prefs framework/uio does not use all of the enactors it would be helpful to only have to include the styles that are needed.Â 

Providing the enactor styles both as separate and combined files would allow for more flexibility in what the integrator includes.
