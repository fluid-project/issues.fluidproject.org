      "body": "Sepideh and I have had more discussion about managing the programCounter when moving blocks while the program is paused. We considered a number of options, listed below, but none stood out strongly to us as being the best choice. We are deferring work to change the behaviour to the future and for now we are going to leave the behaviour as is: when moving blocks, leave the programCounter unchanged.\n\nOptions identified:\n\n* Aim to keep execution at the current program position\n  * This is the current behaviour, with the addition of handling moving loops and moving blocks and loops into and out of loops\n  * This is the option that we explored above in the rules listed in the first comment\n* Move the programCounter with the block being moved, if the block being moved is where the programCounter is\n  * This feels consistent with the behaviour we have for insertion and deletion\n  * But it couples the programCounter to the block being moved\n  * Moving the active block would now move the programCounter and would enable moving the programCounter forwards through the program or backwards through the program, such as into the middle of a loop, or before a loop that has already been executed and whose number of remaining iterations is 0\n* Disable movement of blocks when the program is paused and only enable when stopped\n* Disable the Control Panel entirely when the program is paused and only enable when stopped\n* Remove the ability to pause the program (only Play and Stop) and only support editing when the program is stopped\n* Keep the current implementation until we come up with a better solution\n  * We decided to go with this option for now\n"

Steps to reproduce:

* Make a program: forward, backward
* Play the program, pause such that the programCounter is on backward
* Add a loop to the beginning of the program
* Move the forward and backward blocks into the new loop

Expected:

* The programCounter stays on the backward block

Actual:

* The programCounter moves to the endLoop block
