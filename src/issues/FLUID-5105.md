Tracing the activity of \"{that}.buildPrimary\", the dynamic grade of the component, this triggers the evaluation of {that}.options.auxSchema - this in turn triggers the evaluation of {that}.options.auxiliarySchema. Given this is partway through the process of resolving dynamic grades, the additional material supplied as direct options has not yet been seen. We can try to fix this, but in general you should avoid the use of invokers in grade resolution which depend on material which is itself dependent on dynamic grade information, since this runs the risk of encountering a circularity in evaluation.\n\nIt may be possible to resolve this issue by moving towards a 3-phase approach for resolving dynamic grade information, where the use of invokers is deferred to the third phase.\n"

As I explain in the JIRA, I'd prefer not to \"fix\" this issue without another confirming instance of the problem, since allowing people to cut the ginger world timing so finely runs the risk of creating code which is very difficult to follow. In practice, the original issue was resolved by the old-fashioned means of creating an extra component - although in this case I feel the effect was to improve the system design.\n"

This problem can be seen in the current state of the UIOptions builder.

The auxiliary builder is currently assigned a "fluid.uiOptions.auxSchema.starter" grade that contains all the specification for the starter panels, enactors, etc: <https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-4907/src/components/uiOptions/js/Builder.js#L25>

This is incorrect and in fact should be changed to just "fluid.uiOptions.auxSchema" grade that is by default empty.

Whenever the user configures uioptions builder and by extension uioptions themselves, they have an option of passing an auxSchema gradeName that contains the required configuration. For example, this is demonstrated by the current uioptions demo: <https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-4907/src/demos/uiOptions/js/uiOptionsDemo.js#L23-L25>.

However this does not work at the moment because the framework does not resolve the "fluid.uiOptions.auxSchema.starter" defaults when passed as options to the builder.

More specific test case to follow.
