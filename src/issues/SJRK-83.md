Create and hook up a ui/page/view for viewing a single story. This is intended to be shown either after the editing process has been completed and the user has hit "share", or if the user has navigated to a pre-existing story by some other means.

Much of the functionality of this will be shared with the existing grade "sjrk.storyTelling.ui.storyViewer", which may need to be renamed or refactored as a result of the similarity.
