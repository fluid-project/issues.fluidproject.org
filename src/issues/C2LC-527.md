Steps to reproduce:

 

1. Place focus on the actions menu button
2. Use the “enter” or “space” key to open.
3. Press the “esc” key
4. Notice that nothing happens. Although “enter” and “space” would toggle the menu closed here.
5. Use the “tab” key to move focus into the actions menu
6. Press the “esc” key
7. Notice the menu closes.

 

Note that on iPad keyboard covers that don't have a physical "esc" key, the combination of "command+." will trigger an escape.
