Steps to reproduce:

1\) open the generic lightbox example on the daily build page:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/generic-lightbox/generic-lightbox.html>

2\) drag one reorderable element and drop it somewhere (doesn't have to be a valid drop target). Notice that the avatar has a transparent  \
background.

3\) without selecting anything else, begin to drag the same element again. Notice this time that the avatar has an opaque background.
