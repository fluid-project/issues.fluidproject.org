Just working on the design pattern and I noticed that the current pattern shows up in the list of related patterns.  Is it possible for that not to happen?  When I'm looking at the related patterns I can't actually see the title of the current pattern.  Since I'm looking at the drag and drop patterns, it gets a bit confusing.
