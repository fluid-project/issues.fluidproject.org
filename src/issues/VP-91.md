The video player currently has a 'buffered' property in the model which is a TimeRanges object. This is likely to cause odd and difficult to trace bugs when passing the model around through IoC. We need to refactor this code to use a plain old javascript object instead - if it's even appropriate to store this information at all.&#x20;
