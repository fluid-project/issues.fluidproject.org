If the field is not observed at any point in the cycle, the newline will be \"magically\" removed by the browser and the test will fail.\n"

Any text after a newline character is ignored. It should wrap to another line.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open in-line edit demo from the the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Open an in-line edit field in edit mode

3\) cut & paste the following text:

"before newline\
after newline"

Notice that only the first line is displayed and all the text that came after the newline characters are ignored
