Cannot see the title of unopened accordion panels in High Contrast, with Background Images off. Note you can see the title when the focus is placed on it.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/ui-options-fss-sakai.html#>

2\) Set the contrast to the "High Contrast" theme and background images to "no", save changes

3\) Re-open the UI Options dialog notice that the "Easier to find" title is not visible.
