They are wonderfully convenient.

Using the latest code (Rev. 4952), Progress tests partially fail in IE6 and IE7:

In IE6 running in Virtual PC:\
8\. After update to 0, indicator width should be 1 expected: 1 actual: 4\
10\. After an update to a smaller value (10), style should include 'width: 10%;'

In IE7 true:\
10\. After an update to a smaller value (10), style should include 'width: 10%;'
