Here is an example of  a multi file input <http://jsfiddle.net/L2Kcd/> For the uploader, it creates new inputs every time a user adds files to the queue, to support adding additional files. This means that a user will always interact with an empty input.\n"

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Navigate to the "browse files" button\
Notice that it is announced as  "no files selected file upload button". Note that you can navigate to the label which is read as "Browse Files" but this isn't activatable.
