The Try It activity under the Insight of Diverse Participation and Perspectives does not include anything to do with diverse participation. Add another Try It, or change the activity to reflect both diverse participation and diverse perspectives. <https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/insights/DiverseParticipationAndPerspectives.html>
