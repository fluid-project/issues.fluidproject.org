There are some old DNS records at utoronto.ca that point to IP addresses in our network. This causes URLs like this to work: <https://project.courses.utoronto.ca/browse/GPII-1826>

We need to add a rule to nginx redirecting everything to use the proper domain name, so Google slowly updates its records and visitors are not confused anymore.

E.g. if $host != issues.fluidproject.org then redirect to issues.fluidproject.org

This should be done for the following websites:\
issues.fluidproject.org\
issues.gpii.net\
wiki.fluidproject.org
