As part of the "Documentation Sprint" underway, it is a good time to reassess the state of commenting and documentation for core functions. Functions with unclear motivation and especially those which are not intended to be part of the public framework API should be clearly marked, and documentation for many completely new framework features (IoC, "event boiling", "grades", renderer components etc.) is required.
