Although such resources are generally rare on the client-side, it is necessary to supply an optional lifecycle endpoint on the "destruction" of a component to allow such resources to be freed. For example the image gallery uploader app <https://github.com/colinbdclark/image-gallery/blob/0b4138369b78bda2f160d817194e9b8a17c32d6a/js/uploader.js> reveals that the SWF Uploader implementation requires cleanup of some flash gubbins at the end of its life. \
IoC should operate this lifecycle point automatically on applying "clearComponent" as well as its being surfaced as a conventional method "destroy()"
