I'm seeing a few selector classnames in the starter panel markup that don't seem to be used anywhere in the code. They're probably leftovers from earlier versions of the component. It would probably be a good idea to go through all the markup, etc. and clean out anything that's no longer used. There may also be style classnames that aren't needed anymore.

Example: SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.html has a flc-prefsEditor-separatedPanel-tabs class that isn't mentioned anywhere in the code.
