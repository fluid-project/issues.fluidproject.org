In IE8, the video player does not show the first frame of the video - thus the video appears white-on-white. The first frame does not appear until mouse hover or keyboard focus on the player. The controls, however, render properly.&#x20;

To reproduce:\
1\. Load IE8 and clear the browser cache.\
2\. Load the demo <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>\
3\. Notice how the video player container renders properly except for the video itself.
