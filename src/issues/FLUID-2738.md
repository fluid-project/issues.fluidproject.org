Links and Inputs under "Easier to Find" are left justified instead of being centred

Steps to reproduced

1\) Open the Â¨UI Options example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uiOptions/html/UIOptions.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/ui-options-fss-sakai.html>

2\) Open the "Easier to Find" accordion panel

Notice that the Inputs and links sections are left justified

For FF the labels and checkboxes are all left justified.
