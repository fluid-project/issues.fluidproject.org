The CSS class names used throughout the project are somewhat inconsistent, and should be brought into a more consistent state. They should also conform to CSS class name conventions.

E.g. we have classes like "sjrk-storyTelling-....", "sjrk-storyTelling-block-....", "sjrk-storyblock.." et cetera. This is inconsistent and potentially confusing. They are also using uppercase letters, which are verboten.
