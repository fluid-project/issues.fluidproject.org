The ids of components get the 'pref name' prefixed; for a radio button, the "rowId" would become "pref\_name\_rowId", but the relativeParentID doesn't get this prefix, so it is "..::rowId" instead of "..:: pref\_name\_rowId". The search for the parent is unsuccessful, and the rendering of the radio buttons fails.

I discovered this issue while implementing some composite panels in order to document the process. The code that illustrates the issue can be seen in my branch:\
<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/tree/PFID>

To reproduce the issue:

1\) Check out the branch

2\) Edit Open src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/js/composite.js to\
a) un-comment the "radioTest1" block of the auxiliary schema:\
<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/PFID/src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/js/composite.js#L152-L163> \
b) un-comment the reference to radioTest1 in the composite2 group\
<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/PFID/src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/js/composite.js#L190>

3\) Open src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/index.html in your browser, watching the console

You will see the following error in the console:

ASSERTION FAILED: Error in component tree - UISelectChoice with id learning\_radioTest1\_frequencyRow::learning\_radioTest1\_frequencyInput has parentRelativeID of ..::frequency-radio which cannot be resolved

The reference to the parentRelativeID has not been re-written to include the "learning\_radioTest1\_" prefix, and so it can't be found.
