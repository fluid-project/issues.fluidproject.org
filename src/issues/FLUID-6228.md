When you tab focus the contrast panel, it is not automatically scrolled into view. This was initially found in the UIO+ browser extension and filed under <https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2725>

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the [UIO demo](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/)
2. Open the prefs editor
3. Using the keyboard tab through the adjusters to reach the contrast adjuster

Notice that the contrast adjuster gets focus, but it is not scrolled into view if it had been offscreen.

 

It seems that this is related to the backing radio button input being marked as position fixed (separated panel) or absolute (full page).
