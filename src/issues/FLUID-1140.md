When dragging a portlet's avatar, if you drop it when the pointer is just higher than the top edge of the drop target, the avatar freezes.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Start dragging a portlet

3\) Attempt to drop when the pointer is just higher than the drop target. That is, the bottom edge of the pointer is resting on the top edge of the drop target. For an arrow, it is the bottom of the lowest point, not the bottom of the tail.

4\) Notice that the avatar is frozen where you released the mouse.
