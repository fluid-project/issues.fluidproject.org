In working on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-471#icft=C2LC-471> and <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-472#icft=C2LC-472>, I noticed that both of them had a padding of 1rem that was overridden.Â  I just noticed that that rule is coming from the KeyboardInputModal, both would be fixed if we more tightly constrained that rule rather than letting it clobber the defaults.
