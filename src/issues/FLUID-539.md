      "body": "This has been investigated in some detail now, with no real understanding of the issue emerging. There is a possibility that the particular markup used here is implicated - that is, an anchor tag within the \\<li> which occupies more physical space than its parent. Basically a tab order cycle results, with the next focus target after the active tab being considered the container itself, possibly via the intermediate of the anchor. An interesting focus effect has been observed on FF2 whereby a container with tabindex is considered focused if one of the elements within it are focused. This is particularly visible in the portal sample - putting focus onto one of the dropdowns for example on the top right portlet.&#x20;\n\nThere was an experimentation with a \"dynamic tabindex\" version of the keyboard accessibility plugin, but this appears to create more instability in focus than it resolves.\n"

You are able to use the "Tab" key to navigate into the set of reorderable tabs, but are not able to use the "Tab" key to leave them.&#x20;

For FF2 on WinXP you are able to use the arrow keys to navigate away from the set of reorderable tabs, after pressing the "Tab" key a second time.
