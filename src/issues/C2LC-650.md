To reproduce:

* Make a program with 1 or more loops
* Play the program and pause it at a point when the number of iterations has been decremented
* Put focus into a decremented loop iterations input box
* Take focus out of (blur) the iterations input box
* Stop the program

Expected:

* The number of iterations should reset back to what it was before running the program

Actual:

* The number of iterations has been set in the program to the decremented value even though the user never changed the value
