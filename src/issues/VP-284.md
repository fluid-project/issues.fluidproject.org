Keyboard scrubbing stops working after attempting to move the scrub bar. Happens while video is paused, but appears fine if video is playing.

To reproduce:

1\. Load demo in IE8\
2\. Press tab until scrub bar has focus.\
3\. Press Right arrow to move the scrub bar.\
4\. Notice it stutters along then stops working (around 8s - 13s mark).
