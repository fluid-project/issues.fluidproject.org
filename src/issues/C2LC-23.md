Use react-intl `injectIntl()` directly on component class(es) to avoid creation of anonymous functions in `render()`.

The following are sketches of a couple of approaches.

## Either a component with a name something like `IntlContainer`

* Contains internationalization supports, messages, and current language state
* App is its only child component

```java
render() {
    return (
        <IntlProvider
                locale={this.state.language}
                messages={messages[this.state.language]}>
            <App>
        </IntlProvider>
    );
}
```

We can then use `injectIntl()` directly in `App.js`:

```java
export default injectIntl(App);
```

## Or, move the localizable user interface out of App

* `App` would contain internationalization supports, messages, current language state, and other application-wide state
* Any UI that needs localization is in child components of `App`

In this model, `App` would contain the `<IntlProvider>` container (as now) and children would contain:

```java
export default injectIntl(WhateverChildComponent);
```
