Leah will sit in on walkthrough wireframe meetings with the DIA and take notes.  She will then analyze the notes and make recommendations back to the team as to what steps need to be made to develop wireframes further. &#x20;

Deliverable:  Written document with key recommendations for the team to discuss and prioritize. \[KM, JW, AB]
