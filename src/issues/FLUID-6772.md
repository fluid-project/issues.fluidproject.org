The change in which removed the UIO iframe has caused a horizontal content overflow issue in Webkit and Chromium browsers. The same issue cannot be reproduced in Firefox.

For a minimal reproduction, see the following:

✅ <https://github.com/greatislander/uio-bug/tree/infusion-4.4.0> (deployed to <https://infusion-4-4-0--uio-bug.netlify.app> )

❌ <https://github.com/greatislander/uio-bug/tree/infusion-4.5.0> (deployed to <https://infusion-4-5-0--uio-bug.netlify.app> )

❌ <https://github.com/greatislander/uio-bug> (Infusion 4.6.0, deployed to <https://uio-bug.netlify.app> )

Visit the deployment of each branch in a Webkit or Chromium browser, open the UIO panel, and scroll all the way to the right. Not the excess white space. The same issue does not present itself in Firefox.
