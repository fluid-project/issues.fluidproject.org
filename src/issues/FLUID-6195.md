Whilst writing a fix for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6191#icft=FLUID-6191>, it was observed that until the exception triggered during the relay parsing was improved to be a framework exception, the framework's model transaction state would become permanently corrupted, leading to widespread failures in all the following tests in the file. We should ensure that such records are cleaned up in all possible failure cases, at the very least once our FLUID-6148 potentia II rewrite is implemented.
