This was previously exposed as FLUID-3237, which noticed that the test introduced for FLUID-2980 was failing since it tested a recursive invocation of the renderer by using an empty template. It was decided not to fix this for the 1.1.2 release, so a dedicated test case and fix should be supplied for 1.2 under this JIRA.
