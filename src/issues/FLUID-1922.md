We currently link against jQuery UI 1.5.1. The latest stable version is 1.5.3. Let's upgrade to the latest stable version, but also ensure that we're compatible with the latest trunk version of UI 1.6, which is due out any day now. This will ease the upgrade transition for our end-users signficantly.
