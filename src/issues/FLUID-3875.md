In the new HTML 5 strategy for the Uploader, we have to hand-roll a standard multipart request in Firefox 3.6, due to the absence of the FormData object. Our current implementation works, but needs improvement, including:

* we hard code the multipart boundary, instead of randomly generating as is typical
* we need to verify that we correctly support the full UTF-8 character set, such as file names with special characters in them
* File.getAsBinary() is blocking, and may need to be replaced with Firefox's FileReader API
* concatenating strings and binary data together is sketchy, and we should verify that it's actually viable for any kind of file
