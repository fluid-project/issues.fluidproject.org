The Orator demo ( <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/> )is broken because the TTS dependency points at <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/components/textToSpeech/js/textToSpeech.js> instead of <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js>

The differences is just that the TextToSpeech.js file name should be heads up camel case instead of heads down. This isn't always caught when testing locally because of case insensitivity.
