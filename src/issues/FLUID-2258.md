The UI Options Dialog is virtually blank in simplified layout&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Sakai mock-up from the daily build site\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html#>

2\) Open the UI Options Dialog by clicking the "Edit Appearance" button

3\) Change to the "Simplified Layout" and save the changes

Notice that the UI Options dialog is almost completely blank, with the exception of the header and the combo boxes

If you close the dialog and then reopen it, you will be able to see the dialog properly.
