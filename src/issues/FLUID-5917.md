[As described](http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2016-May/009971.html) on the fluid-work mailing list [Infusion's CI job](https://github.com/fluid-project/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/fluid-infusion.yml) does not currently run any tests after a build is generated. This should change now that we have a mechanism for running Fluid jobs on CI build nodes also used by other projects.&#x20;
