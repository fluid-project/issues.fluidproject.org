It does seem that since they're buttons, they should enlarge with buttons, not with font size.\n"

      "body": "The problem is NOT because the buttons are just background images. The current scaling technique (setting the font size to 125%) would work if the size of the buttons was specified in ems. In the case of the video control buttons, they're NOT specified in ems, they're specified as a percentage of their container size.\n\nSo the solution may be to re-jig the base styles so that the button sizes are specified using ems instead of %.\n"

Make inputs larger doesn't change the buttons size. Check in with a designer for what should happen.&#x20;
