The VideoPlayer has a grade of "rendererComponent" but it does not rely on existing the framework supports for loading renderer component templates. Intead, it calls fetchResources itself in its finalInit function.

A more appropriate way is to create a template loader subcomponent to coordinate the timing of the template loading, prime the template cache, and use the rendererComponent's internal fetchResources.
