We support the use of the core, non-view portions of the Infusion framework in Node.js, and hope to publish a npm module for Infusion soon.

However, there is currently no way to run the Infusion framework unit test suite in Node.js (or at least the subset of them that are Node.js-friendly).

jqUnit and node-jqunit does enable tests to run in both environments with a little bit of work. We should create a new test runner file that aggregates and runs all appropriate tests in Node.js
