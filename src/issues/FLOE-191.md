Determine the current state of EPUB reader devices and try to classify them if possible. This research will help us identify which class of device are more inclusive (thus the ones we would suggest in our guide).

Possible questions to answer include:

* is video available on e-ink devices? Check the spec sheets online
* what constitutes "rich media" device? Come up with a list
* can you have controls on content narration / media overlays?
* which devices support Media Overlays and / or Text-to-Speech?

This research should go under <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Inclusive+EPUB>
