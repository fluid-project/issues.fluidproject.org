The "Recently Updated Design Patterns" block does not display new patterns submitted to the OSDPL, just the patterns that have been edited. This fact is confusing to users as they expected their just published pattern to be displayed in this block.

This may not be an issue for much longer because the community workflow will ensure that as patterns move from Draft to Published they are Edited by others... hence ensuring they appear in this block.
