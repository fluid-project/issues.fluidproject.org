At the moment, the Video Player supports only CapScribe's native JSON-based caption format. It would be excellent to write a parser for YouTube's captions, especially now that AutoCaps and transcription syncing are available. Here's a page that outline's the YouTube caption format:

Should be pretty simple to write a regexp-based parser for this format, converting it into JSON.
