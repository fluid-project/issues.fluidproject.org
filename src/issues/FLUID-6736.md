      "body": "cc Ned ZimmermanJustin ObaraAntranig Basman\n\nSelf voicing stops working in Safari due to [a webkit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243055).\n\n[A pull request](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1089) is issued to work around the Safari bug by always assigning a speech synthesis voice at speaking instead of leaving the voice option to \\`null\\`. This change breaks some tests because the \"fluid.textToSpeech.utterance\" mock was not complete since it did nothing to override the construction of [the native “utterance” member](https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-6736/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js#L482). We made a mock Utterance and found that the tests hang through expecting the “onStop” event to be fired at the expected time. To save the time spent on this, we made [the mock getVoices()](https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-6736/src/components/textToSpeech/js/MockTTS.js#L165) return actual speech synthesis voice list instead of a list of objects. This fixed broken tests.\n\nMoreover, Ned will not use orator from infusion, and SelfVoicing is not configured as part of the out of the box configuration of UIO on any of our supported sites, so we can punt on this issue until we come to make the UIO 2 release - in the meantime Safari may have resolved their bug.\n\nThe PR is mothballed.\n"

SelfVoicing ( Text-to-Speech ) is no longer working in Safari 15.4. It seems like it may be related to this version of Safari returning an empty array when speechSynthesis.getVoices() is called.
