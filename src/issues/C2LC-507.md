Itâ€™s difficult to scan the keybindings to find ones appropriate for the action you want to achieve. The most distinct parts are the keys to press, but you have to read all the text to the right to know what they are for. Which includes re-reading the key combination before the action is mentioned.

On GitHub and JIRA these are reversed with much less text and only mentioning the key combinations once.

See the 0.9 QA Notes for more details.
