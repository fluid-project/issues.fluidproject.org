The instantiation code is called as the result of a fetchResources call to bring in the  config file. However, we don't wait to ensure that the overviewPanel's container has been loaded into the DOM. Fortunately, in most cases, the fetching of the config takes longer than the DOM load, but in cases where it doesn't, we get the error. The proper way to handle this would either be to wrap the instantiation code into a $(document).ready call or provide an instantiator function that is called after the container has been loaded into the DOM.\n"

If navigating away from the Prefs Framework demo and returning to the demo, an error occurs and the overviewPanel does not appear.

This is the error:\
ASSERTION FAILED: Instantiation of autoInit component with type fluid.overviewPanel failed, since selector " .flc-overviewPanel " did not match any markup in the document.

To reproduce:\
1\. Load the Prefs Framework demo - <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/demos/prefsFramework/>\
2\. Select the "Code" link which takes you away to another domain (i.e. github)\
3\. Press back on browser.\
4\. Notice that when arriving back on the demo page, the overview panel is not there.

Observations:

* It is possible the bug doesn't appear in every attempt. Just go forward away from the demo and back again.
* Using the "Code" / github link in the overviewPanel seems to reproduce this problem with higher probability (4 out of 5 tries causes this problem)
* The error claims "flc-overviewPanel" can not be found, but it can be seen in the markup.
* This seems to occur primarily in Firefox
