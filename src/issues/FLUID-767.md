Create an enlightening and concise page about designs of Fluid Components that would interest lukers, contributors, and integrators.

Possible questions to answer:

* Why are we doing this.
* What are we doing? What we do in the future?
* How can someone help.
* How someone can use the designs (download a Fluid component, or use a design pattern).
