      "body": "Evaluation is done. There's too much change happening on Rancher 2.0 and our focus is to first make all application run inside containers. Additionally, there's not enough logging/auditing, rke installer breaks frequently on CentOS 7.x, kubernetes service catalog support is alpha, and Terraform providers aren't great (more to come in 2.1 with import/export cluster configuration).\n\nInformal information received from people close to the project is to wait for Rancher 2.1 (2018 Q3). <https://github.com/rancher/rancher/wiki/Rancher-2.1>\n\nThere's no pressing business need to adopt it right and our Ops team is small. Will re-evaluate if requirements change.\n"
