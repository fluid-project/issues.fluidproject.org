      "body": "When I test this on my macbook screen in FF, the transcripts do initially appear, overlapping the video a bit. When I play the video, they disappear. On a bigger screen, the same thing happens, but playing the video simply moves the transcript window over so that it's no longer overlapping the video.\n\nThis seems like some kind of CSS positioning problem on the smaller screens. Perhaps the transcripts are still there, but just accidentally moved somewhere offscreen...\n"
