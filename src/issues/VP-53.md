The selected language in the captions menu is successfully modified, but if the captions are visible at the time of the change, the actual caption text on the screen doesn't reflect the new language choice until the caption is hidden and then re-shown.\n\nTo reproduce:\\\n1\\) Show captions and click the scrub bar so that the video is positioned somewhere that captions are on-screen.\\\n2\\) Use UIO to change the caption language\n\n* note that the highlighted language in the caption menu has been correctly updated\n* note that the onscreen caption text language has NOT been correctly updated\\\n  3\\) Hide and then show captions\n* note that now, the captions are in the correct language\n\nNote that transcripts are fine, and do correctly respond to UIO changes in language preference.\n"
