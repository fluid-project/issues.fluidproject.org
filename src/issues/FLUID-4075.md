If a file is added to the uploader queue with a very long filename, it pushes the 'remove' button out of sight. In Firefox, this doesn't affect the 'remove' buttons for other items in the queue, but in Safari, all remove buttons are lost. You can still select the items in the queue (using mouse or keyboard) and remove them using the Delete key, you just can't see the icons.
