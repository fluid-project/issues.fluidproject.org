We'll definitely need to support easy (and automatic) scrolling, but we may also want to consider using up as much of the horizontal screen space as we have available to us, too.\n"

From Leanne:

"The scroll bar doesn't move automatically when the window fills with code...some students will have difficulty with moving the scroll bar to reach the next spot in the sequence (small in size, click and drag movement etc..).  Is there any way that this can automatically move to reveal the next empty code block, as  the window fills?  Or perhaps it's as simple as making scroll buttons on the screen?"
