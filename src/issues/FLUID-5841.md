fluid.prefs.create takes in configuration for the builder and prefsEditor. If you want to make configuration changes to the prefsEditorLoader you have to supply a loaderGrade to the auxiliary schema. This make things more complicated if you are using a different auxSchema as a base grade as you have to know what loaderGrades it is already supplying. loaderGrades is an array which will replace rather than merge when merging auxSchemas.&#x20;
