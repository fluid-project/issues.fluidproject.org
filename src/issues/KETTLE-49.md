We currently have two mostly unrelated schemes for contributing "writable" versions of DataSource grades into components.

The first, historical scheme consumes a boolean option named "writable" and uses this to manually compute a gradeName based on the option named readOnlyGrade:

```java
kettle.dataSource.getWritableGrade = function (that, writable, readOnlyGrade) {
    if (!readOnlyGrade) {
        fluid.fail("Cannot evaluate writable grade without readOnlyGrade option");
    }
    if (writable) {
        return fluid.model.composeSegments(readOnlyGrade, "writable");
    }
};
```

The second scheme, currently only used for the mixin grade "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB" uses the IoC grade linkage system to consume a generalised "kettle.dataSource.writable" grade and output the concrete writable grade: <http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluid-makegradelinkage-linkagename-inputnames-outputnames->

```java
fluid.makeGradeLinkage("kettle.dataSource.CouchDB.linkage", ["kettle.dataSource.writable", "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB"], "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB.writable");
```

This confusion has confused implementors of new DataSource grades in the current PouchDB work on the GPII - <https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464#pullrequestreview-3041008> - a crucial commit is <https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464/commits/71594c2b444a7350f3cf6561d22cb301978ba290> .&#x20;

We should sort out this confusion when we refactor DataSources - presumably in favour of the second, linkage-based system, as the TODO comment at <https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-core.js#L187> suggests.
