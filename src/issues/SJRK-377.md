The [current README.md](https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/README.md) for the Storytelling Tool repo is very long and difficult to navigate. This is a combination of both the amount of content in the file as well as the formatting of it.

The following should be addressed:

* Examine README files for other large projects on GitHub for some good methods
* Keep only basic info in the README and provide an organized list of links to the other files in the "docs" directory
* Improve the formatting for best readability
* Add any applicable [badges](https://shields.io/) such as Licence, Docker build passing/failing, etc.
