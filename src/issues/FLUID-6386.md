"Mercury Parser extracts the bits that humans care about from any URL you give it. That includes article content, titles, authors, published dates, excerpts, lead images, and more." 

It is supposed to work through a server, command line, or in the browser. It could be useful to provide an option to summarize the page content for a user.
