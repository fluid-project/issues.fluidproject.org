The code to look up messages in a message bundle for non-renderer components is currently in SlidingPanel.js. However, this seems like a useful function that should be moved to the framework as a general utility for any component to use. It looks like the discovery tool will already need to make use of this.

Current code:

fluid.slidingPanel.lookupMsg = function (messageResolver, value) {\
var looked = messageResolver.lookup(\[value]);\
return looked ? looked.template : looked;\
};
