Dialog opened by fck editor is missing

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the rich text inline editor\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/rich-text-inline-edit.html>

2\) Open one of the fck inline edit fields into edit mode

3\) Do something that causes the dialog to open, such as attempting to add the link using the toolbar&#x20;

Notice that in FF and Opera, a 404 error is given in place of the dialog\
In Safari no dialog is displayed but the page is still blocked as though a modal dialog was there.\
In IE it is relatively unnoticeable that a dialog is missing.
