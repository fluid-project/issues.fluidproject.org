All work correctly.\n\nA few more style changes may make it look better:\\\n(1) change .orderable-avatar's width from 300px to auto. This can prevent the content wraps in the avatar.\\\n(2) add .orderable-avatar's list-style-type to none. This can prevent the avatar has a list sequence number assigned to it.\n"

The fix here is good for this specific sample, but ideally I think that whilst we always want to allow room for users to improve and \"tweak\" component behavaiour with styling fixes, this component should work well under a broad variety of styling choices and not be dependent on individual ingenuity to get correct basic behaviour ðŸ˜› Hopefully this will be resolved more globally as part of the overall umbrella of  <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-1148#icft=FLUID-1148>.\n"

No drop target appears below the last item in a sortable list.

You can still drop an element below the list as long as the last list item takes up more than one line.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sortable vertical list example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/todo-list/sortable-styled-todo-list.html>

2\) Attempt to drag and drop an item to the last position. Notice that no drop target appears.&#x20;
