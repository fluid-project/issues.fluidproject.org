Add functionality to the server's "Delete story" endpoint to iterate over the blocks and automate the removal of all media files associated with a particular deleted story

Note:

* We should be wary of situations with identical file names
* Make sure it canâ€™t delete a file for one story which is also used by another (verify whether this situation is possible)
* Make sure to have review from several people
