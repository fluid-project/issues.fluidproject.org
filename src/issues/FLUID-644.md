There are some things we want to make sure we do in the design/development of every component (e.g. gather use cases, choose primary personas, create wireframes. storyboard several contexts of use, user testing, define keyboard & ARIA interactions....).  There are many other activities  we may choose to do in certain circumstances.  It would be nice to have a design process to point the community to and for our reference.  This is meant to be the 1st iteration of such a process defined.

Daphne to create a whiteboard strawman for the team to iteration on.
