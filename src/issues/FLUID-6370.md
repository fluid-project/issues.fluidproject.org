The topic sidebar experience on the Handbook and Design Guide site can be problematic. If the sidebar is closed, it is not clear there are additional topics to explore.

On screens with sufficient width, the sidebar should always be visible (remove the hide/show toggle).

On smaller screens, the topics will need to be presented in another way as to not obscure the main content. Perhaps a navigation menu.
