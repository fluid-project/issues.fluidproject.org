The drag-and-drop classes that control the styles are not properly being updated when keystrokes are used to move focus. As a result, styles are not being properly updated, and the most-recently-dragged item remains styled with a grey background even when keystrokes have moved focus to another item.

The keystroke handling code needs to be aware of the drag-and-drop classes, and update them accordingly. This probably involves removing them, but it might require moving them to the newly selected item.
