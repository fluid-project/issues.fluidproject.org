I'm investigating the root cause which appears to be the message bundle not loading correctly for 2nd and subsequent UIO instances but in the meantime I've raised <https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35> in which to accumulate suggestions for refactoring. My sense is at the moment there is a fault in the very-oldfashioned resource loading code in Infusion master, which is being exacerbated by there being a lot of component leaks in the SJRK implementation. Once I find the root cause of the race we should be able to patch it in Infusion but at the same time we should also head off the issue by removing the leaks in SJRK which should also result in better performance and a design that is easier to work with.\n"

NOTE: This may be a duplicate / the same root cause as SJRK-234

***

A race condition present in sjrk.storyTelling.base.page is blocking properly-functioning tests for bothÂ sjrk.storyTelling.loadStoryFromParameter andÂ sjrk.storyTelling.loadBrowse (both in storyTellingServerUI.js).

These tests were meant to be added alongside the changes described in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-237#icft=SJRK-237>, but the work required to remediate them would be substantial, hence this Jira.

To reproduce:

1. check out this branch:Â <https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/tree/SJRK-255>Â (at commitÂ [cf3c37c](https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/commit/cf3c37c3d82857469284f39056c8bade52eac718), ideally)
2. run the database server (instructions in README)
3. run the webserver
4. navigate toÂ <http://localhost:8081/tests/html/storyTellingServerUI-Tests.html>

Expected: all tests passing, no errors

Actual: sometimes tests pass, sometimes they fail with error
