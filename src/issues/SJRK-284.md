Re-enable the ability to select the language of the UI. This was disabled in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-211#icft=SJRK-211> on account of issues identified in SJRK-199, but this was only ever meant as a temporary measure.

* Restore the ability to select the language in the UI
* Update any out-of-date message bundles (es, pt, etc)
* Investigate SJRK-97 to ensure it is still happening
* Investigate <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/SJRK-146#icft=SJRK-146> to ensure it is still happening
