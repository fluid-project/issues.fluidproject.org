An AR like interface where students can see themselves as they are taking different actions, such as drawing, dancing, moving, etc.&#x20;

Description from source:

A more immersive interface, similar to AR, seems to resonate more with Beverley students. Cause and effect was easier to discern compared to previous sessions where they had to divide their attention between a computer and something happening in their physical environment

We could do design and dev experiments
