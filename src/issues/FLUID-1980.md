There are a number of problems with the Uploader Springboard related to the new Uploader 2 way of doing things.\
Here are the one's that I know of that are currently unfixed:\
A) the Uploader would fail on init. Caused by more than one fl-uploader-queue object in markup. \
B) Remove buttons not working, because the selector had changed \
C) Row template in the second example being visible. \
D) Remove buttons are showing after upload\
E)  instructions are showing after load\
F) progress bars are showing before upload\
G) Upload button is active before load and after upload complete
