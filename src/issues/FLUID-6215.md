The Fluid community adopted a code of conducted based on [Contributor Covenant v1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html). This is reflected on the [Inclusion in the Fluid Community](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusion+in+the+Fluid+Community) wiki page.

 

GitHub provides a facility for displaying our Code of Conduct in the repositories community page. We should add the code of conduct to the repo so that it is displayed there and also available for contributors and users to see.

 

See: <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/>
