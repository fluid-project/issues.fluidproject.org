In Firefox 18, clicking mute and unmute has the wrong focus style. It shows up as grey on blue, but it should be white on blue.

To reproduce:

* Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html> in Firefox
* Click Mute / Unmute
* When un-hovering the button, you will see that the icon isn't properly coloured.

The other buttons are fine.
