Currently the OSDPL refers to itself as the "Open Source Design Pattern Library" or OSDPL, but the site shows a prominent Fluid logo and conflicting URLs (uidesignpatterns.org and osdpl.fluidproject.org).

We should consolidate terminology to use "OSDPL" and be less Fluid-centric.

Also, we should consider getting a domain osdpl.org and opensourcedesignpatterns.org

All these URLs should direct to osdpl.org.
