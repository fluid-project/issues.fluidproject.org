Problem statement should be documented on the main page of the component design space.

A potential framework for thinking through the problem statement is:

The problem of...  (problem description)

affects... (the people impacted by this problem)

the impact of which is...  (how are the people effected by the problem)

a successful solutions would...  (list the benefits of a proposed solution)

Reviewing pain points should help define the problem we want to solve.&#x20;

Reviewing known use cases and scenarios should help think through the problem statement.&#x20;
