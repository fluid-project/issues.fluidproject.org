<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1072/files> demonstrates two failures that look like they stem from a common cause. In this case an array is used as the source for a set of dynamic components, and for the first of them, theÂ `{sourcePath`} reference holds a value of Number 0. A lazy falsy check within fluid.expander.fetch <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/main/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L3462> causes the the interpolation to be skipped - exacerbated by the reference being named "component" in the expectation that the dominant path for resolving bare context references resolved onto components rather than random material in the localRecord.

```java
fluid.expander.fetch = function (deliverer, source, options) {
....
    var component = inLocal ? localRecord[context] : fluid.resolveContext(context, options.contextThat, fast);
    if (component) {
....
```
