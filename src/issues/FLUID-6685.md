The existing CodeCov bash uploader is deprecated and will be sunset in Feb 2022.Â 

<https://about.codecov.io/blog/codecov-uploader-deprecation-plan/>

We'll need to update the GitHub action to the latest current version (v2).

<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codecov>

Until it is updated we will see intermittent downtime and a loss of new coverage checks as of Feb 2022
