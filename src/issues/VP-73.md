Using the keyboard, focusing and pressing Enter or Space on the transcript language selector does not open the drop-down menu as per convention. Pressing space or enter on the dropdown should reveal the options.

To reproduce:

* Open <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Open transcripts
* tab focus the language drop-down at the top of transcripts
* press Enter or Space
* Notice that nothing happens.
