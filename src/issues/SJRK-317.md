The Browse page is currently limited to loading a maximum of 100 stories. This is defined at [this line](https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/server/dataSource.js#L42) in the code:

```javascript
limit: "100",
```

This is a reasonable number for a single page (perhaps even too high), but without pagination it means that we have at the same time far too many stories for one page and also the inability to see anything after the 100th entry, regardless of what's in the database.

To solve this, I propose either implement pagination or removing the limit altogether and deferring a pagination system to another Jira (in that case, please file said issue).
