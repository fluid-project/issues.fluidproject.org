If using FSS reset, black focus outlines will appear in IE8 on elements not intended to receive focus. For example, table cells and even the body element will receive a 2pc black outline.

To work-around this issue, the following can be added to CSS:\
:focus { outline: none; }

However, this solution may not be ideal because it affects the global namespace.

If using this workaround, you will then have to specify focus styling for the elements you intend.
