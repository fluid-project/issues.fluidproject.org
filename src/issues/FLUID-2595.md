Somewhere in the process of refactoring for Infusion 0.8 we lost the meta data editing step that happened once the all the images had been uploaded.&#x20;

There are a few of things that need to happen to bring it back:

* Change the afterFileUploaded event to add the image data to the form as the images get uploaded.

- Change the afterUploadComplete event to fire off the form.submit().

* Add the proper listeners and UI elements to the Image Gallery to handle Done and Cancel.
