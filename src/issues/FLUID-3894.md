Uploader allows keyboard to delete files during upload.

To reproduce, go to: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/demo.html>,\
1\. Click "Browse" and select a few files.\
2\. Click "Upload" once there is a list of files in the uploader. \
3\. Tab (with keyboard) into the file section and press "Delete" on your keyboard.

You will notice you can delete all the items from the uploader, including the one that's uploading.
