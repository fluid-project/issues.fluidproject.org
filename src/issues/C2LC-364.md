* Opening a new tab and closing it causes whitespace at the bottom of the Weavly window
* 1\) View Weavly as the only page open in landscape mode (no tabs)
* 2\) Tap '+' to open another tab
* 3\) Close the Favorites tab

- Clipping can sometimes still occur on Safari on iPad and Safari on Mac
- 1\) View Weavly as the only page open in landscape mode (no tabs)
- 2\) Open a new tab
- 3\) Go back to Weavly with the tab bar opened
- Simon does not see clipping in this case on the C2LC iPad that they have, but Daniel sees it on his iPad and so does Avtar; on Mac, the clipping occurs sometimes and can be corrected by interacting with the page
- Michelle sees the issue on 15.0.2 and it goes away by interacting with the page
