From Lisa:

"The skip to content link should be the first tabbable link on every page, so I think it should appear before UIO. The link can be hidden generally but should be visible when tabbed to so it can be used by keyboard only users. Hereâ€™s an article on the topic and it goes over the method of hiding it until tabbed to (you can also see an example of how this work on that site): <https://webaim.org/search/?q=skip%20to%20content%20link>"
