Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open a reorderer demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/gridReorderer/> \
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/> \
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/listReorderer/>&#x20;

2\) Navigate to the reorderable items (note due to FLUID-5424 you'll need to manually switch to focus mode - NVDA+space)

3\) use the keyboard to reorder the elements\
Notice that there is no screen reader feedback provided.
