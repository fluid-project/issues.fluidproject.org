Create a "Contact Us" page where a user can send their questions or comments. Ideally it would be a form instead of a email link to make it easier to use.

The contact page should list:

* the primary contacts (email and possibly Wiki profile)
* a link to a directory ("who's who list" - see FLUID-708)
* explanation of other ways to contact us (mailing list, IRC, IM, etc) and link to the relevant "Get Involved" page

Thoughts:

* may need to set up a general inquiry address like "info at fluidproject.org"
* alternative would be that comments are posted to a central private location like a forum or mailing list where appropriate people can respond
