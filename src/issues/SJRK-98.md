One of the devices used in Medellín was unable to load the tool

The device is apparently a Lanix Ilium X210 from Claro: <http://catalogo.claro.com.co/home/EquipoDetalle/Lanix-X210>

Potential avenues of investigation:

* install Android Studio and create an emulated version using AVD
* low available storage (88 MB free listed on device in question and storage warning was active)
* slow connectivity (it was listed as being connected to WiFi), can be simulated using Chrome Inspector or in Windows using Fiddler to throttle connection
