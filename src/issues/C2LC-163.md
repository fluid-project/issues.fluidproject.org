Would you be able to dig in a little bit more and see if you can find the code that is responsible for adding our files to the browser cache?\n\nThe comment you highlight:\n\n```java\n// At this point, the updated precached content has been fetched,\n```\n\nCan you find the code that is fetching the content and adding it to the cache – which code has ensured that \"precached content has been fetched\"?\n"

      "body": "\"To install a service worker for your site, you need to register it, which you do in your page's JavaScript. Registering a service worker will cause the browser to start the **service worker install step** in the background.\n\nTypically during the install step, you'll want to cache some static assets. If all the files are cached successfully, then the service worker becomes installed.\" – under The service worker lifecycle section on <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers>.\n\nAlso, the service worker generated from cra's script has a flag \"clientsClaim\" set to true, which means that service worker will get called immediately with new changes (including updated assets) – \"When a service worker is initially registered, pages won't use it until they next load. The claim() method causes those pages to be controlled immediately.\" <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients/claim>\n\nWhich implies that if service worker is installed, every assets specified are cached.\n"

It just means that the service worker is responsible for it. If it stores it, and where, is the responsibility of the service worker.\n\n\"Typically during the install step, you'll want to cache some static assets\" – in our case, who is caching the assets?\n\nRegarding your conclusion \"Which implies that if service worker is installed, every assets specified are cached.\" We are certainly observing that the assets are being cached, but who is specifying what those assets are and who is caching them?\n\nCould you upload the generated service worker? It would be helpful to see that, I think.\n"
