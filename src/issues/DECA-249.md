If an error occurs on import and server, an error message is returned to the client. However, the client doesn't do anything with it.

Steps to reproduce:&#x20;

1\) Launch Decapod

2\) Attempt to import and generate a pdf from non-image files\
Notice that the progress spinner appears to continue forever; however if you look in the server logs and/or firebug you will see that a 415 error was returned.
