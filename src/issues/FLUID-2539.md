This will cause confusion in the expectation of up/down functionality.\n\nI suggest that either the styling be converted to a grid (i.e. horizonal, and flowing) or the list reorderer be used instead. This might actually change the behaviour, and render the issue moot.\n"

Down movement via down arrow not working, with dynamic reorderer

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the dynamic reorderer manual test \
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/dynamic-reorderer.html>

2\) Using the keyboard tap the "tab" key until one of the reorderable elements has focus.&#x20;

3\) Attempt to move one of the reorderable elements down in the set

Notice that crtl-down arrow doesn't work. You can move items down in the list by going up and having it scroll around, or by using the ctrl-right arrow.
