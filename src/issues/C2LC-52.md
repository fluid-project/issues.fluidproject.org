There is an option for tracking different body movements to draw, make music or select an item.&#x20;

 

Details from co-design:\
"Splatter Painting"&#x20;

* Different ways of interacting with the system include movement:&#x20;

- Using sensors on body parts&#x20;
- Detect movement using cameras

 

Low-fi development experiments are underway with Eyegaze&#x20;

Head/Body tracking is not started
