Many implementations of the reorder will need to let users know how the keyboard interactions work.  By default no instructions are shown.  There is currently reference to the instructions in the docs but we may want to update and be clear about why and when to use them (hmmm...this is sounding very design patternish – I'll check the pattern and create a bug for it if it doesn't mention the instructions).

We may also want to describe an example of what we are thinking here – perhaps we could use the lightbox text as an example.  There is also an oustanding bug to update those instructions, <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-329#icft=FLUID-329>.  	&#x20;
