The default line height of the text in the UIO demo is too tight, and causes the lines to overlap with each other.

This happens even when no settings are applied, but is most visible when one carries out the following:\
1\. Increase text size to maximum\
2\. Change contrast theme to b/w\
3\. Note behaviour of text and line height under section 1 of "Some helpful tips"
