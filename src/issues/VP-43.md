The Captionator code stores the track element's readyState inside the element's TextTrack object. The spec states that the readyState should be stored in the track element, as a sibling to the TextTrack object:

<http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#the-track-element>

Safari's native implementation of the track element follows the spec correctly, whereas our current VideoPlayer code uses the incorrect Captionator API. We need to bring the Captionator code in line with the spec so that we can have consistent behaviour across browsers.
