In Chrome 66 on Windows 10, the text-to-speech used by the "Listen to my story" button will only read part of the content when reading in Spanish.

English seems to work fine, but Spanish does not.

Possibly related to <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6119#icft=FLUID-6119>

Tested in Edge 41, but the button does not work at all. Using the browser's built-in Read Aloud feature, it does not read in a Spanish voice (may depend on system language settings rather than DOM lang attribute).\
Tested also in Firefox 60; while the button works, it only reads in an English voice. Again this may be due to system settings.
