In IE8, the native full-screen button is still focusable by tabbing even though it is invisible on the UI. When in full-screen mode, the video plays in fits, and exiting full screen causes the video player to no longer be focusable by keyboard.

To reproduce:\
1\. Load the demo in IE8\
2\. Tab until focus appears on the video player container (notice the dotted outline).\
3\. Tab again - notice that focus disappears into the Ether.\
4\. Press Enter - the video player will enter full screen.\
5\. Exit full screen\
6\. Now attempt to tab focus the video player again - notice that the video player is no longer in the tab order.
