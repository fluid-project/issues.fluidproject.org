A component that has a name starting with "source" cannot be referenced through IoC by its name. Using "{that}" does still work. Although this won't allow the parent to be referenced from a subcomponent.

Example:&#x20;

fluid.defaults("fluid.sourceSomeName", {\
gradeNames: \["fluid.eventedComponent", "autoInit"],\
listeners: {\
"onCreate.pass": {\
listener: "console.log",\
args: \["{that}"] // outputs the component\
},\
"onCreate.fail": {\
listener: "console.log",\
args: \["{sourceSomeName}"] // outputs undefined\
}

}\
});&#x20;
