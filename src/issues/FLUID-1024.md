Can't tab focus the file queue at all.

Steps to Reproduce:

1\) Open either of the version of uploader from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/uploader/inline/index.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/uploader/pop-up/index.html>&#x20;

2\) Add some files to the file queue

3\) notice that you can't tab focus the file queue, whether the scrollbar is showing or not
