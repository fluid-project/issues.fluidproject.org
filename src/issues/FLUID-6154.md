After adding in the arrows beside the headers ( see: <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5534#icft=FLUID-5534> ), the headings no longer line up for the adjuster panels in IE 11 when viewed in a small width screen. This seems to have to do something with the use of a flex box layout ( display: flex ) on the h2; which is required to laying out the header text and arrows properly.

Â 

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the [UI Options demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/) in IE 11
2. Shrink the windows width until the "mobile" view is displayed.
3. Scroll through the available preferences
4. Notice that the headings for each panel are at different heights
