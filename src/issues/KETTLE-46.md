Currently, the node-unique dataSource components live in one file, with the browser-safe components in another file.

To make it possible to use `kettle.dataSource.URL` with `browserify` (see [GPII-1587](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1587)), we should further compartmentalize the pieces that can only ever run on node (such as the dataSources that use the "fs" module) from things like kettle.dataSource.URL, which can conceivably be run in the browser using browserify.

This spike would not add client-side tests, it would only confirm that all tests pass once the code is reorganized.  To preserve support for references to the old structure used in calls like `fluid.require("%kettle/lib/dataSource-node.js");}, I plan to require the new file from within {{dataSource-node.js`.
