The connection spinner is displayed correctly during connection, but no Dash icon is visible.

It looks like the Dash icon is present in the DOM and it takes up space in the header. So this is likely a styling issue? Though there is a difference between running the application with ‘npm start’ (icon displayed correctly) and ‘npm run build’ (icon not displayed).

To reproduce locally:

Get the latest develop-0.3 code\
Run a build with: npm run build\
Run a web server to serve the ‘build’ directory; for example:\
npx serve build
