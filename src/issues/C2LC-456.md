At higher zoom levels and/or smaller browser window sizes, various controls end up offscreen.  For example, when working with a Chrome browser window that is 1440 pixels high:

1. The play/share controls move offscreen starting at 200% zoom and are completely offscreen at 250% zoom.
2. The Program block editor moves partially offscreen starting at 250%, and is unusable by 300% zoom.
3. The scene refresh button normally on the right side of the scene becomes unreachable at 400% zoom.
4. The actions panel is still (barely) visible at 400% zoom, but does not display even a single complete command block.

In desktop environments, it's possible to get into a state where no page scroll bars are available, which prevents reaching these elements using a mouse wheel, arrow keys, or any other typical scroll mechanism.  You can reach them using tab navigation, or by zooming out.  This problem is common to Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

As mentioned in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-442#icft=C2LC-442>, the zoom problems are worse when "zoom text" only is checked in Firefox's preferences.  For example, the play/share controls go offscreen at 170% zoom.

There are also unique concerns regarding the iPad.  We have discussed addressing this using a scroll container for the whole document, but this may not be enough.

On the iPad, it's possible to pan around when zoomed in, but you have to "grip" a portion of the page that is not itself a scrolling container.  This becomes a problem if you manage to zoom in so that the scene occupies the whole viewport.  Once that happens, you will no longer be able to pan around unless you use a keyboard or change the zoom level.
