      "body": "Notes: both a 'title' attribute and an 'aria-label' attribute on the video element will be read by Jaws and NVDA (not VoiceOver). The 'title' attribute is read twice, for some reason. Because of this, I feel the 'aria-label' is a better choice.\n\nAnother note: the aria-label is read, but nothing is spoken that actually indicates that this is a video. I recommend prefacing the title with something like \"Video: \" so that you'd here \"Video: Mammals\" for example.\n"

---
Jaws+FF:\
When focus lands on the video, Jaws says "Use Jaws key plus alt plus R to read the script of text." Note that pressing Ins+Alt+R does nothing.

NVDA+FF:\
When focus lands on the video, NVDA says "application grouping section."

VoiceOver+Safari:\
When focus lands on the video, VoiceOver says "group."

Jaws+IE9:\
When focus lands on the video (and Jaws is in application mode), Jaws says "video"

NVDA+IE9:\
When focus lands on the video, NVDA speaks everything in it that's text: the time codes, the content of the language menus, the caption, etc (regardless of whether NVDA is in focus or browse mode)
