There are two kinds of error handling as I see it. The first is just if something happens wrong with the component or with saving back to the server. The other is "validation", the component behaved well but the data did not conform to the values expected by the application. I don't know if we want to handle the latter.

Dev & design should collaborate on what errors we want to handle and how.
