Justin's wonderful new progress bars show a great bug in the Progress component that if the window resizes forcing the progress bar to resize (in the case of a bar sized relative to the viewport) or reposition (in the case of bar positioned relative to the viewport as in centered) the progress indicator does not resize or reposition.&#x20;
