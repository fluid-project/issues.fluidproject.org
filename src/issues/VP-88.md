When UIO is used to enlarge inputs, the persisted preferences (i.e. after the page is reloaded) are not being correctly applied to the video player controls.

The enlarged-links change is accomplished by adding an extra class (fl-text-larger) to any inputs. I suspect the UI Enhancer is doing its work before the VideoPlayer template is fully loaded, and hence the changes are not being applied to the button elements.

To reproduce:

1\) Load the demo: <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>\
2\) Use UIO to make inputs larger (in the Links and Buttons tab)\
3\) Verify that the change has been applied\
a) Until <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4649#icft=FLUID-4649> is resolve, you won't visually see a change, but you can use DOM inspector tools to confirm that the 'fl-text-larger' class has been added to the button elements\
4\) Reload the page.

The saved preferences should be applied (other body-wide changes are applied, such as contrast or font-size) but the 'fl-text-larger' class is NOT present on the button elements.
