In the light theme, the contrast between the disabled gray caret (#f1f2f4) and the button background (#d5d8dd) is: 1.27:1

<!-- media: file a07dd31a-9ccc-4238-a743-241d2875928c -->

The greyscale theme is intentionally low contrast.

This does not seem to be related to recent colour changes, I see the same issues in the default/mixed themes in production.
