Add a "Clear all" button that allows deletion of all story blocks at once.

(Mockup needs updating to show Clear All button along with existing block delete button.)

Note: this Jira previously included the implementation of individual block delete buttons (replacing the check boxes and delete button). This functionality has been separated out into SJRK-395.&#x20;

#### **Design questions:**

* Does "Clear all" clear the title, author and keywords as well, or only blocks?
* Is the "Delete block" button disabled at any point? If so, when? E.g. during upload?
