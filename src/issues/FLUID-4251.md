Be sure to update

* the version number,
* the zip file names (which include the version number),
* the list of third-party version numbers and licenses,
* the "What's New" section with a list of features of the release,
* folder hierarchy if it has changed at all (e.g. new sample-code folders added),
* the list of supported browsers if it has changed, and
* the "Known Issues" section with highlights of the known issues.
