The success message in Section Info is a customization and needs to be since what the message says and where you put it is very context specific.  However, we think it is very important that integrators have a success message.  90% of users in testing weren't certain their changes were saved.

We'd also like to see something in the tutorial for inline edit about this.  Once the change has been made to the design pattern, discuss with Anastasia the best way to get this into the tutorial.
