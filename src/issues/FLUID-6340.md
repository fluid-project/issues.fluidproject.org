The current 2FA support for NPM requires a one-time password (OTP). We've handled this by allowing the users to pass in an --otp=123456 (where the number is replaced by the specific otp). This works but not when there is a long prepublish step. In those cases it will always time out. NPM is able to handle this by prompting the user to re-enter the otp directly. However, fluid-publish catches the error beforehand so the user is not presented the option to re-enter. 

 

We should not catch the 401 errors and let NPM handle it so that a user can just be prompted. We should still keep the otp flag, which is similar to how NPM works.
