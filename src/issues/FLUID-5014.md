Case 1: When one source value is defined to be passed down to more than one sub-components, only the first sub-component receives the value.

The test case for this issue: <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5010/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2507-2548>

Case 2: When one source value is defined to be passed down to both its own sub-component and a sub-component of its grade component, only the sub-component of its own receives the value.

The test case for this issue: <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5010/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2550-2594>
