Add a note explaining how the "Submit" buttons on the pattern data entry form work so users don't think they have to submit every time they work on a tab. The "Submit" buttons on each tab apply to the **entire** pattern (all tabs), and users do not have to submit every time they complete work on an individual tab. Instead, they can work on several different tabs and then submit them all at once.&#x20;

In an ideal world this button would also be named "Save" rather than "Submit," but Jonathan tells me this is difficult to change in Drupal as "Drupal depends on the keyword "Submit" to properly save info to the database."
