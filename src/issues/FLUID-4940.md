uiOptions demo fails trying to resolve jQuery

uiOptions demo fails if Infusion is built without jQuery included\
ant -lib lib/rhino infusionAllBuilds -Dexclude="jQuery" -DnoMinify="true"\
but included through a script tag.

There is an error in the demo /build/assembled/demos/uiOptions/html/uiOptions.html\
at line 18002: that.renderUIOContainer = that.jQuery("body", that.iframeDocument);\
because there is no jQuery attached to iframeWindow\
var iframeWindow = that.iframe\[0].contentWindow;

This issue is most likely the reason for OERC to fail in IE\
