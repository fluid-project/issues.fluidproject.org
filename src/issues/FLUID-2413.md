Avatar for the nested reorderer includes the outer reorderable element: using IE

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the nested reorderer manual test page\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/tests/fluid-tests/manual/reorderer/nested-reorderers/nested.html>

2\) Attempt to move one of the sub-list items

Notice that the avatar contains the parent item and all of the siblings
