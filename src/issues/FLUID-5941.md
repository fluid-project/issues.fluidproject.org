The sidebar remains display:none in the docs-template when the sidebar is expanded. The problem appears to only affects IE11 on Windows.

The root of the issue appears to be the .docs-core-sidebar-expanded .docs-template-topics { display: initial; }

If this is set to display: block instead of initial, it should fix the problem.
