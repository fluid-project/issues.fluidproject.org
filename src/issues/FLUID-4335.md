This is analogous to the facility supplied by jQuery.live() and jQuery.delegate() event binding functions: When a listener or event binding specification refers to a component which does NOT YET EXIST via "{component}.events.Xxxxx" type specification, this should be converted into a specification to supply the relevant configuration to such a component that WILL BE MATCHED when it is constructed via "createOnEvent".&#x20;

ALSO - further interaction is required between the IoC system and the "clearComponent" function - when a component is cleared from the tree, any listeners that were bound WITHIN it on its behalf by the IoC system should be removed. This implies that there needs to be a standard "destroyComponent" lifecycle point.
