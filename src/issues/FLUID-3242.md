On the home page of the demo portal, the following typos:

In the 'Infusion JS Framework' column:\
"The following module are" should read "The following modules are"

In the '' column:\
The UI Options blurb starts with "Transform the presentation..." while all other blurbs start with "The XXX component does something..." This should be changed, for consistency.

In the 'Integration Examples' column\
"Some demos for efficiently using multiple components..." is confusing - I don't know what the 'for effciently' means??

"Framework + Componets" should read "Framework + Components"
