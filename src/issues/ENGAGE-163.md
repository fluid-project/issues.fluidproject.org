The wireframes for this feature are available herer:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Mobile+wireframes%2C+draft+8#Mobilewireframes%2Cdraft8-Mycollections>

This is an umbrella issue that covers all the tasks required to implement the My Collections feature of Engage. In short, this will include:

* Creation of a My Collections component that supports grid and list views as well as artifact reorderering
* A generic persistent navigation component that will allow us to provide navigation between screens within the system
* Data models for users and personal collections
