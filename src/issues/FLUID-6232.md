Perhaps it can be re-used:\n\n<https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Installing+and+Getting+Started+with+UI+Options>\n\n \n\n\"\n\n1. Get Infusion by typing \"`npm install infusion`\" in the command line and pressing Enter. The process will run and a new directory called `node_modules` will be created as a result.\n2. Using the command line, change directory into the infusion directory that's been created within `node_modules`.\n   1. On Windows type: \"`cd node_modules\\infusion`\" (without quotes) and press Enter.\n   2. On Mac type: \"`cd node_modules/infusion`\" (without quotes) and press Enter.\n3. Now build Infusion by typing \"`npm install`\" (without quotes) and press Enter. Once that is done, type \"`grunt`\" without quotes and press Enter. This will create a \"`products`\" directory in the Infusion directory.\n4. Within the `my-project/temp/node_modules/infusion/products` directory, there is now a ZIP file called \"`infusion-all-2.0.0.zip`\" (the exact filename may be a little different depending on the release of Infusion available at the time you download it). Unzip this file using your preferred Unzipping program.\n5. Now copy (or move) the resulting \"`infusion`\" directory into your project's root directory.\n\n\"\n"

Currently the UI Options documentation only includes the ZIP download method for acquiring Infusion.

See: <https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html#download-and-install-the-ui-options-library>

This documentation should be updated to also include the npm install method.
