Create a seperate page for jira how to on the wiki

Currently it is on the Testing fluid components page:\
<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Testing+Fluid+Components>

It should be on a seperate page so that it can be linked to for people who want to file bugs, but may not be doing it in the context of testing. (i.e. a user who happens across a bug)
