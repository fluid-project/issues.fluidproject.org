In Google Chrome, using NVDA with transcripts - the entire transcript is read from the beginning even if a different piece of text is selected in the transcript.

To reproduce:

* load NVDA
* launch demo in Chrome <http://build.fluidproject.org/videodemo/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* reveal transcripts
* tab to transcript text area
* Press NVDA + Enter to go into browse mode (default key is INS + Enter)
* Arrow down to a different text block
* Press NVDA + Down Arrow
* Note: the proper behaviour should read from the current location, but NVDA will begin reading from the start of the transcript again.

This does not happen in Firefox.
