Instead, it immediately calls removeAttribute(\"aaa:activedescent\") under the assumption that it's safe and faster to just attempt to remove the element, regardless of if it is present.\n"

At least with the Scheduler markup and use of the Reorderer, there is an error in IE6 that renders it unusable. Upon instantiation of a Reorderer, IE6 complains that there is an "invalid argument:" on line 76 of the Reorderer:

if (this.domNode.getAttribute("aaa:activedescendent")) {\
this.domNode.removeAttribute("aaa:activedescendent");\
}

The problem seems to be with the call to getAttribute("aaa:activedescendent"). The SchedulerTests show the problem. It may be worth checking with Simon on the best way to be getting and setting these namespaced ARIA attributes.

My concern was that this may happen with any markup that initially lacks these attributes, but I can't get the todo list markup to reproduce. Perhaps it's a bug in the scheduler.
