When uploading files. If the pointer is over top of a file in the queueu, before it starts uploading, the individual files progress bar will not be displayed.&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open one of the uploader demo pages from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/>

2\) Add some files to the upload queue. Easier to see if you use larger files

3\) Click the 'Upload' button

4\) place the pointer over one of the files which has not yet uploaded. Notice that when it starts uploading, its progress bar is not displayed
