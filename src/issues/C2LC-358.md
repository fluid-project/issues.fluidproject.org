NVDA with Firefox on Windows reads the Scene content different from Chrome on Windows and is a worse experience.

 

TODO: Set tabindex=”-1” on the scroll row and column label containers

 

Steps:

 

* Use NVDA’s heading navigation (press ‘h’) to get to the “Scene” H2 heading
* Use NVDA’s content browsing to read the document content following the “Scene” heading (press the down arrow)

 

Chrome:

 

* “Scene heading level 2”
* “Graphic \<scene description>”
* “Checkbox checked pen down”

 

Firefox:

 

* “Scene heading level 2”
* “Blank”
* “Blank”
* “\<scene description> Graphic \<scene description>”
* “Checkbox checked pen down”

 

In Firefox, the row and column headings are read as “Blank” and the scene description is read twice.

 

On Firefox on Mac with VoiceOver, the row and column headings are read but the scene description is only read once.
