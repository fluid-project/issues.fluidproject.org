How to get to "browse a subject area" page: On "Browse all" page, click on a subject area that has OER items

A couple of issues:\
1\. The page layout is broken by default: the section to share and comment this page sits on top of the OER item list;\
2\. Select a high contrast theme that is not white background, on the left panel, the number besides each subject area shows a white background.
