Demos shipped with Infusion and on the demo portal should be eating its own dog food / using good Fluid Infusion principles:

Examples:

* make sure DOM binding is being done properly.
* components are being declared, even for code specific to demos.

Quote Bosmon in the IRC:

"So, for example, I observed that the demo didn't make use of the DOM binder properly, or even define a Fluid component at all\
Which are all things that we would expect that a user of our framework "naturally would do", even if these points didn't illustrate anything relevant to the particular plugin being demoed"
