If we ever decide not to have any sort of moderator, that should probably be revisited.\n\nI did also try to create a subcategory for Drag and Drop under Information Organization, but processing the URL generated (e.g. taxomony-menu/1/2/25) is more difficult (if not impossible) than processing a URL generated with just one level of hierarchy in a category (e.g. taxonomy-menu/1/2). So, again, for now I think we can leave this to us to handle in the  menu system.&#x20;\n\nIn the future it **would** be nice to show a more semantic parent-child relationship between UI design pattern nodes, as is possible using the \"book\" content type, so I will leave this as a future task.\n"

is there a way to make a node a child of another node in a way other than using the menu? - looks like only books have the concept of a parent node. The drag and drop pattern should be the parent of the drag and drop - layout preview and drag and drop - list ordering patterns. Tried creating a subcategory under Information Organization called Drag and Drop, but couldn't make it work as I don't think it's possible to allow it to be both a subcategory & a page at the same time.&#x20;
