PackageKit is responsible for managing installing / updating new software, especially through the desktop environment.

It's usually not necessary in the Vagrant box because we provide updated boxes regularly. Besides that, if users are changing the development environment that creates problems for CI as there's undesired configuration drift.

The Fedora vagrant box is configured by default with a 2GB memory limit.
