At the moment, the HTML5 strategy in the Uploader assumes the queueSettings.fileSizeLimit option is specified in megabytes instead of kilobytes. As a result, it multiplies the value by 1000000 when converting to bytes, causing the fileSizeLimit to be interpreted as 1000x larger than it should be. The current contract for the Upload clearly specifies that this value should be in KB, not MB

This should be fixed by either changing the contract to take MB (and updating the Flash strategy accordingly), or by correctly converting kilobytes in the HTML5 strategy.
