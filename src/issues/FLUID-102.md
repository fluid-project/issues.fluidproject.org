All Fluid code is now dual-licensed under the ECL 2.0 and New BSD licenses. Sheila has put together a page describing how we include license and copyright statements within our code and source repository. The policy is described here:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Licensing>

All source code files should include the new embedded license text  that will be available here.  At present, this is just a template, not the full licence text.  It requires the copyright and full urls to the licences to be added.

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Embedded+Fluid+license>

A LICENSE file should be included at the top level of our source code repository. The contents of this file is available here:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+License>
