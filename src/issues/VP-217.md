To me, it seems that a toggle button is more semantically appropriate for the captions control: the user is triggering the show/hide of the captions. I will make it a toggle button.\n"

We can probably tidy up the template for the Video Player, making changes such as

* slightly shorter class names
* remove jQuery UI class names
* remove hard-coded strings (in favor of a scheme that supports localization)
* double-check choice of element types for consistency (e.g. \<button> vs \<input> vs \<div>

We also need to clean up the code and ensure correct interactions.
