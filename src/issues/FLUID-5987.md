Steps to reproduce:

1. open the [UIO Demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/)
2. open the sliding panel by triggering the "show display preferences" button
3. Notice that the panel only slightly opens and nothing is visible
4. Notice that clicking reset causes the panel to open properly
