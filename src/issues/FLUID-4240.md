Trying to stop a multi-file upload results in unpredictable - and incorrect - behaviour.

To reproduce:

1\) Open the test uploader on the build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uploader/html/uploader.html>\
Choose any one of the versions of uploader.

2\) Add three or four files to the queue. Try to make sure the files are large enough that each will take a moment or two to upload (otherwise you won't have time to try to stop the upload).

3\) Click "Upload"

4\) While the first file is still uploading, click "Stop upload" once.

Result:\
a) The 'total status' at the bottom will stop showing "1 of 4" and switch to "2 of 4"\
b) The progress bar on the first file will disappear and then reappear, still on the first file, and continue\
c) The upload process will continue with "2 of 4", "3 of 4" and "4 of 4" with the corresponding progress bars showing on the first, second and third items.\
d) Once completed, the total status will indicate that 3 of 4 files did upload, and the first three files will have the green checkmark; the last will not.

Variations:

A) Suppose you've placed 5 files in the queue. If you hit stop 3 times, the progress bar will continue to reset itself on the first item each time, and the final tally will show 2 of 5 files uploaded, and the first two items will have the green checkmark.

B) If you click "Stop" for the same number of files in the queue (e.g. 5 clicks for 5 files), it will eventually stop, and show "0 of X" files uploaded.
