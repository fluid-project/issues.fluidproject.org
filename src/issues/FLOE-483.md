Insights:

* DONE - edit "Try" section of One Size Fits One to read "how could this design be improved...Or, consider 3 adaptations..."
* DONE - change "Try" exercise in Integrated Solutions to the following: "Think of one of your latest projects. List some of the users that it intends to serve. Now consider an alternate solution that would serve an individual or group of users with different needs but the same goal. How could you integrate these two solutions together such that it could meet the needs of both groups?"
* DONE - change the name of "Autonomous User" to "Personal Discovery", and replace "promote user autonomy" in body of text with "empower users"
* DONE - delete "Try" activity in Interconnectedness and just include link to Cause and Effect activity (Jutta may have another activity to use as well)
* DONE - from Disability as Mismatch (Insight), delete User States and Contexts from "Use" and add Inclusive Design Mapping activity to the Try section instead
* DONE - Virtuous Cycles (Insight) - replace first 3 paragraphs with 2 paragraphs on printed card
* DONE - User-Continued Design (Insight) - replace text with shorter card text

Practices:

* DONE - Collaboration - replace "creating a living portfolio" with "keeping a history of contributions to the work"
* DONE - Co-design: replace online text content with more concise card content
* DONE - Work Openly: typo - "Present work to larger groups on a regular basis to solicit contributions and feedback"
* DONE - Focus on Functional Needs - add "When engaging in co-design, or when developing personas and use-cases, taking ..." and under Try, add "When co-designing, conducting interviews or writing personas ..."

Tools:

* DONE - UX Walkthroughs - delete "based on proven conventional inspection procedures" - replace with card text "This tool is a synthesis of conventional methods (... from both a user's point of view and that of the designer" - also delete "by combining elements from proven techniques"
* DONE - Usability Testing - replace "from the early stages of design to production systems" with "from the early stages of design to the final stages of production"
* DONE - Accessible Design Tools - replace text with "Few of the design tools ... (for example, the ability to attach descriptive text..., to enlarge the controls, or to navigate and execute designs using a screen reader)"
* Remove User States and Contexts? (see Inclusive Mapping Tool in Activities)
* DONE - Use-cases - add "scenarios in which a user or persona may ..."
* DONE - Use-cases - in Try section add "user or persona" to #1 and #3
* DONE - Use-cases - typo in Try #4 (form instead of from)
* DONE - Mindmaps - we need to add an example! suggest <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28PGA%29+Mind+Mapping>
* DONE - Synchronized Design Assets: see printed card for content rearrangement
* DONE - Infusion - add link to User Interface Options (demo)

Activities:

* DONE - Matching Game - replace text with card text
* DONE - Inclusive Mapping - replace text/content with printed card text - add printable facets file and link
* DONE - Cause and Effect - replace text/content with printed card text
* after final review, add activities created by Tim and Godfrey
* include their examples somehow as well?

Additional Feedback from jhung:

Tools:

* DONE - \* Usability testing: Try #1: Awkward phrasing. Perhaps “…reassure the participant that you are not testing them, and only evaluating the design”
* DONE - \* Accessible design tools: Awkward phrasing "Few of the design tools most commonly in\
  use have accessibility features”. Rephrase to “Very few popular design tools have accessibility features”.
* DONE - \* Wireframes. Ending first paragraph with "etc." is a bit odd. Rephrase to "getting into the details, such as style and colour."
* DONE - \* Prototyping: Try #1. "online - one of these tools that is fairly easy to learn and use is InVision." Rephrase to "online. For example, InVision is a prototyping tool that is easy to learn and use."

Insights:

* DONE - \* Personal Discovery. Instead of "- what works for you?", rephrase to: " "what works for you?" " (i.e. remove hyphen and put "what works for you?" inside quotes).
