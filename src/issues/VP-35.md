When a webkit browser's built-in 'zoom in' functionality is used (i.e. Cmd-+), after two zooms, the caption and transcript menus and the volume slider are not longer visible. Not sure if they're visible but off-screen, or obscured, or what.

To reproduce:\
1\) Open Safari. Use the 'View' menu to ensure the page is showing at "Actual Size."\
2\) Load the video player demo page. Confirm that the menus do show up when you click the button.\
3\) Press Cmd-+ at least twice.\
4\) Note that the menus still show up (and the video itself hasn't enlarged)\
5\) Reload the page. The video itself will enlarge this time\
6\) Try to open the menus. They will not appear.
