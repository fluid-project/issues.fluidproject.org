Because of jQuery's use of "this" the framework is not able to handle jQuery functions that are passed into the func property of an IoC call or the listerner property for an event.

Example:

listeners: {\
onCreate: {\
listener: "{that}.dom.reset.click",\
args: \["{that}.reset"] // a function\
}\
}
