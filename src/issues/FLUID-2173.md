Various users have reported a form of "layout corruption issue" when the Reorderer is applied to sort bare \<tr> elements within an overall table - although so far these issues have produced tricky to reproduce. I have created a sample manual-tests/table-tr as a placeholder for a test which demonstrates the issue - currently it seems to work.
