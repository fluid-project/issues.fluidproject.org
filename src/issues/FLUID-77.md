Currently, the return address of the SVN commit email messag to the commit list is thor.atrc.utoronto.ca.  It would be nice if it could be changed to the committer's email address.

It would be nice if the subject line included the folder affected by the commit.

It might be nice if the word 'fluid' appeared somewhere in the subject line.
