The latest version of the front end (<https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/tree/learning-to-learn>) does not currently work when running with the latest version of the server project (<https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/tree/learning-to-learn>). Get it to work.
