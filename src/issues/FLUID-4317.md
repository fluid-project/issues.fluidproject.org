UIOptions uses the fat-panel template by default. The two full-page flavours do not actually override this default to specify their own required templates themselves - it falls upon the integrator to do it. The full-page versions should have a demands block that specifies the correct template.

This **will** require that integrators specify **all** filenames (and replicate anything else that's in the demands block) if they wish to override **any** of them (since demands blocks don't merge, they replace), but this is an overriding problem with demands blocks in general - not specific to UIOptions.
