The ID's generated by the server for saved stories and files (images, sounds, videos) are possibly predictable and not cryptographically secure. These IDs are generated using the "uuid" package from NPM, which itself has an issue filed regarding the automatic and silent fallback from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator to Math.Random():

Review any possible seed values being fed into the uuid code or explore alternatives.
