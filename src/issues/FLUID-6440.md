It always seemed a bit miraculous that we had seemed to implement the ContextAwareness (CA) feature apparently in "pure userspace", via a single raw dynamic grade definition, given how sensitive the dynamic grade resolution (DGR) algorithm is.\
In retrospect, the DGR algorithm can be seen as a member of the class of "do least advanced work first" algorithms that the overall "ModelComponentQix" algorithm referred to in FLUID-6406 is another of.\
In practice, each freshly arriving dynamic grade should kick off a further round of all available grade accumulation algorithms, until we have full grade closure. The framework can do this internally for grades arriving via distributions via fluid.collectDistributedGrades(), but it cannot call out again to ContextAwareness for it to make its own checks.\
We have run into what initially didn't appear to be a closely related issue in the in-progress <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967> for <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6420#icft=FLUID-6420> at the current commit <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967/commits/e8adf6f6ca51a6a4761bbd6f52d8c3a363661fce> - whilst we had adjusted the timing of the FIRST (and currently, only, poll to contextAwareness) for <https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6438> so that we didn't unnecessarily consume options values in later dynamic grade sources before CA could run, this led to a sense of unease that CA was running at a single time point at all.\
In the current commit, we now have a further issue that the grade outputs of CA are being overridden by grades output from a dynamic grade source, fluid.prefs.auxBuilder.buildAuxiliary .\
With a bit of effort, we can see this is just the form of problem we expected, even though CA in this case would not output any fresh grades. The mere fact that it output any grades implies that it should be rerun after any dynamic grade output, leading to any grades that it outputs being re-shunted to the front of the grade list.\
We should check that this is what the closure algorithm would achieve, but it looks like it probably is - although we keep a hash of seen grades, it appears that the "plainDynamic" in the closure algorithm's records is only used in order to determine whether closure is complete, rather than to stop reshunting grades ahead in the grade order.
