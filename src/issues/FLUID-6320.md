Steps to reproduce:

1. Quit any open instances of Chrome
2. Launch Chrome
3. Go to the Orator Demo ( <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/> )
4. Click the "Play" button to read back text
5. Click the "Pause" button to stop the reading

Notice that the playback doesn't pause. If the page is reloaded, or if a text selection is played, the pause will now function properly. Also this only happens after a Chrome is launched. If it is already open before trying the above it is likely to function properly.

 

This is a Chrome bug and has been filed at <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=873812&can=2&start=0&num=100&q=speechsynthesis%20pause&colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Component%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&groupby=&sort=>
