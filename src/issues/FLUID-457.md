When using the tab key to move through and select a tab on the uPortal sortable tabs mockup page (<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/sample-code/reorderer/concrete/uportal-unordered-list-tabs/uportal-sortable-tabs-mockup.html#>) the selected tab is demarcated by very faint, thin black borders around the vertical edges of the tabs. These borders are hard to make out and should be made more visible by thickening them.
