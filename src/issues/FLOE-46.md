      "body": "Anastasia has fixed share icons (showed in the first screenshot).\n\nThe reason that stops us from implementing the high contrast version of icons for Facebook and Google \"like\" images (the 2nd screenshot) is that those links/icons reside in an iframe that's generated by Facebook and Google plugins. So the first step is to find a work-around to create the links/icons on the page instead of iframe.\n\nHere's some research result on doing this for Facebook \"like\" link: \\\n1\\. Do not use Facebook \"like button\" plugin, which creates iframe no matter what method you choose to generate the embed code.\\\n2\\. Create our own Facebook like link that makes use of Facebook connect to add a like. The number besides the like link that shows how many people like this site can be queried using Facebook API - <https://api.facebook.com/method/fql.query?query=select%20like_count%20from%20link_stat%20where%20url=%27oercommons.org%27&format=xml>.\n\nTwo useful discussion threads:\n\n<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2689167/how-to-implement-the-facebook-like-button-to-your-site-without-using-iframe-an>  (@see the first answer)\\\n<http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/5781/facebook-like-button-without-iframe> (@ see the last answer)\n\nAs mentioned in the first thread, using Facebook connect defeats some of the purpose of the social plugins, which is to not require the user to authenticate your site before allowing interactions. If this drawback is acceptable, we can proceed with this solution.\n"

In high contrast mode, the Facebook, Google + and Twitter icons should have high contrast versions.&#x20;
