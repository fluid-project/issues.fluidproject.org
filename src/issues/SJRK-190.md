Add the "Important Notes" section to the UI at the bottom of the story preview, before the publish and back buttons.

The text should read as follows (subject to changes):

"Important notes

• Your published story will be licenced under CC BY 4.0.\
• You won’t be able to make changes to your story once you\
publish.\
• You can have your story removed by emailing\
stories@idrc.ocadu.ca"

 

Please refer to "StorytellingTool\_UpdatedUI\_V6\_SS\_Page\_6.jpg" for the visual design.
