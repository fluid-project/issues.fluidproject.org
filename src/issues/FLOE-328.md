When using gpii.firstDiscovery.attachTooltip in renderer components such as preference panels, a grade component "gpii.firstDiscovery.attachTooltip.renderer" needs to be added as a grade for those components for the tooltip model "idToContent" to be re-calculated at "afterRender" event. However, listening to afterRender requires the panel to be re-rendered. We can move the re-calculation to model listeners to avoid the re-rendering.
