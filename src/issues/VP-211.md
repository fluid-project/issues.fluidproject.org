The VideoPlayer should be automatically querying Amara regarding the current video, to determine if there are already any captions available for it. If so, those captions should automatically be made available through the caption menu. This functionality should be default, but optional: integrators should be able to turn it off.

The SubtitleWidget, used in OER Commons, already does this. We need to incorporate the functionality into the VideoPlayer itself.
