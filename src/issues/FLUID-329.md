We should update the instructions to do 2 things:

* Make keyboard interactions clear for how to select and see a full view of the  image along with how "drag and drop" work.  It currently says, "View an image by pressing Enter. Move an image using CTRL+Arrow Key."  We want to keep it brief but it seems to need a little something more for clarity.
* Either include mouse instructions too or be clear that instructions only refer to keyboard interactions â€“ something like "To use the keyboard to reorder thumbnails...."
