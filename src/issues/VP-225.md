Based on the research in FLUID-4700\
Create a component which would have all required functionality for the track polyfill.

Do it either:

A) Do it from scratch.

B) By separating captionator into 2 parts: Polyfill implementation and Additional functionality added by Chris and reusing the first part as the base for the component.
