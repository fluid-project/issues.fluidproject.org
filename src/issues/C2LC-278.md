We currently don't have consistent ESLint rules for indentation, and variations creep in as a result.  This issue covers adding [the rules Simon suggested adding in a recent pull request](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/pull/108#discussion_r540332704).  This will be reviewed as part of C2LC-263..
