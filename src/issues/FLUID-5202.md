In composite panels, a subpanel's dropdown's model binding is not working: It's not mapping to composite panel's model properly. I discovered this issue while implementing some composite panels in order to document the process. The code that illustrates the issue can be seen in my branch:\
<https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/tree/PFID>

To reproduce the issue:\
1\) Check out the branch\
2\) Open src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/index.html in your browser, watching the console\
3\) Open the sliding panel.

There are two drop-downs in Composite Panel #2. The primary schema for these two dropdowns defines a default that is NOT the first item in the list, but the two dropdowns default to the first item.

The enactors for the preferences merely log the new model whenever the model changes. If you watch the console when the page loads, you'll see the enactor logs indicating that the enactors are initialized with the defaults specified in the primary schema.

The preferences editor instantiated in the demo is stored in a global variable called "prefsEd" so in the console, you can examine the content of the various models to see where the default has been properly set, and where it has not.
