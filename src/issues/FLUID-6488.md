It seems that we cannot simulate a tab press. Maybe just moving focus or calling blur on the element would be enough in the test. \n\nRegarding keyCode being deprecated, we still need to use it in the tests because they keyboard-a11y plugin is specifically looking for keyCodes. We'd need to re-write it using \"key\" or \"code\" instead. The benefit of doing this would be that we could drop the jQuery UI dependency for the keyCodes.\n"

If you agree, I'll file a separate Jira for the update of our docs and testing configuration to reflect this.\n"

That way we had an option for our users to come back to. If we drop support for IE 11 now, we can either put out a beta or some other release that still officially supports IE 11 or just note that the 2.x line is the last that supported it.\n\nAlthough I think what we should do first is to check with the community to see if there is any need for maintaining IE 11 support right now. I believe that will help us to better decide what path forward to take.\n"
