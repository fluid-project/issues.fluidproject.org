Steps to reproduce:

1. Open any of the demos, for example the [OverviewPanel demo](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/overviewPanel/)
2. notice that the icons are missing

It seems this is the case because the style for the font family references the font with the wrong capitalization in the name.
