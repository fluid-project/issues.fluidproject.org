Add tests to ensure sjrk.storyTelling.server.deleteStoryHandler is working as expected. These tests should include:

* tests of the file-system to ensure any files associated with a deleted story are moved to the recovery directory
* calls to the handler itself
* tests of each of the functions used as part of the handler

Tests forÂ sjrk.storyTelling.server.isValidMediaFilename have already been added, but should be reviewed for completeness.
