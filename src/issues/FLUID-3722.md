In the past, we implemented a prototypal non-Flash version of the Uploader using Google Gears. Since Gears served as the basis for HTML 5, some of this implementation should be useful. In particular, the code to manually create multipart MIME file requests (needed in Firefox 4).

This work should be ported to the HTML 5 strategy.
