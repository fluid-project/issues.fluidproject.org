Currently the UI Enhancer is saving a cookie with a name and value and leaving the other cookie fields as default. We may wish to provide the ability to save the cookie with non-default options.

Some useful references for cookies in javascript:\
<http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html>\
<http://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_cookies.asp>\
<http://www.elated.com/articles/javascript-and-cookies/>

The following is a typical cookie string assigned to document.cookie:\
document.cookie =  'ppkcookie1=testcookie; expires=Thu, 2 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC; path=/'

The format is generally:\
1\. First the name-value pair ('ppkcookie1=testcookie')\
2\. then a semicolon and a space\
3\. then the expiry date in the correct format ('expires=Thu, 2 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC') - if this is omitted then the cookie expires at session end (closing the browser)\
4\. again a semicolon and a space\
5\. then the path (path=/) - if path is omitted, the path is the current web path (possibly a single page)

JQuery has a cookie plugin <http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie> - I'm not sure if this is the way to go
