Deleting uploaded files from the file queue will cause it to skip files and hang

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader demo:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/Uploader.html>

2\) Add several files to the file queue

3\) Start uploading the files and click "Stop Upload" after one or two files upload

4\) Using the keyboard tab into the file queue and press the 'delete' key to remove the uploaded files from the file queue

5\) Click the 'Upload' button to resume the upload

Notice an equal number of files, to the ones that were removed, are skipped and that uploader hangs at the end.

This issues is dependent on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-1819#icft=FLUID-1819>
