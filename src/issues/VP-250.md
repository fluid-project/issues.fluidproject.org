Currently, if the integrator wants to specify any custom key bindings, they must specify ALL of the key bindings: The option passed is used to completely replace the defaults. I think in this case, appropriate merging should happen, so that, for example, an integrator could override the volume increase/decrease keys while preserving the defaults for everything else.
