There is no need to wrap the element since the function is always passed a jquery object. Perhaps we should remove the function and set the title inline instead. (line 271)\\\n4\\) setupDisplayView is a confusing name since we also have a 'displayView' subcomponent that refers to something else. This is in the public API so we do need to be careful with what we name it. (line 337)\\\n5\\) It seems that the richTextViewAccessor should be moved into the integrations file. (line 766)\\\n6\\) renderKeyboardTooltip was renamed to be editModeInstruction but a couple references are still in the Integrations file (line 242)        &#x20;\n"

A new display mode renderer function should be added. It and the current edit mode renderer should be factored as template functions that call other public functions to set up the display and edit modes. These other functions should also be public.
