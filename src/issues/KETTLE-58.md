In <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6149#icft=FLUID-6149>, a fix was introduced to allow fluid.require to work in repositories housed in the root of a filesystem.  Mixing this version with older versions results in dedupe warnings.

This ticket covers cutting a dev release of kettle that uses the new (dev) release of infusion, for packages requiring both the <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6149#icft=FLUID-6149> fix and kettle.
