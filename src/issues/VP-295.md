UIO is currently undergoing many changes to make it more extensible, and modify the visual display and interaction. (see: <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4908#icft=FLUID-4908>, <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4927#icft=FLUID-4927>). Once these changes are ready, VideoPlayer should upgrade to the latest version of UIO and make use of it for the media panel integration.

New UIO designs can be found here <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options+design+high+fidelity%2C+C.1>
