Tab focusing the green check mark for a file already uploaded will read "Remove file from queue" â€“ which is incorrect.

Bigger question: should the check marks even be tab focusable since the user can not perform any actions on them anyway? Could be annoying to have to tab through a whole list of uploaded files to get to a file you want to remove.
