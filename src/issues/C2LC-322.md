Currently, there is a variety of behaviour when someone enters an invalid character position.

* Letter input starts with a letter then has a number
* ‘B7’ → set to B

- Number input starts with a letter then has a number
- ‘B7’ → discarded

* Letter input starts with a number then has a letter
* ‘7B’ → discarded

- Number input starts with a number then has a letter
- ‘7B’ → set to 7

* Letter input has letters out of range
* ‘AA’ → set to A

- Number input has number out of range
- ‘111’ → discarded

We should always discard the invalid entry and provide the person with an informational message.
