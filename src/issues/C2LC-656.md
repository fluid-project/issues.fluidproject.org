For the loop styling updates in 1.5, we have increased the size of the loop blocks and they are quite a bit larger than they were in 1.4. This task is to reduce the size a little: find a balance between how they currently are on 1.5 and how they were on 1.4. Larger than they were on 1.4, with more padding, but not as large as they currently are.
