It looks like they are going to add a [retain\\_unknown\\_fields](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/pull/1820#issuecomment-460004634) config option in an upcoming release. I *think* an interim solution could be exposing all the frontmatter fields in the [cms config](https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/blob/master/static/admin/config.yml#L19-L45)&#x20;\n\n \n\n \n\n \n"

Editing and publishing changes to the Landing page and About page on SJRK site with Netlify caused the "type" line in the frontmatter to be removed from the md files (and therefore content removed from the site).  This did not happen when editing and publishing changes to the About page and the Partners page (index files).
