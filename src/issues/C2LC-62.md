Introducing user to an unbuilt world. User can build this world by adding scenes, objects, characters, and other available elements.Â 

* User has access to several controls to modify available options, their positioning, interactions, movements, etc.&#x20;
* Users can share their assets and their worlds and anything else they build

Details from co-design (Avtar): Scene with world elements and characters

* &#x20;Block or node based building environment&#x20;

- Pre-constructed or user created or mix of both&#x20;

* Controls can be revealed when needed

Possible implementation - Paper prototypes - Interactive screensWe have started similar storytelling activities at Beverley using Powerpoint
