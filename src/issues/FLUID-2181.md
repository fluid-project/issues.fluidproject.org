In the case that components are configured with markup that is missing vital selector targets, the error messages from the framework can be unhelpful. For example, in configuring a Pager without any selector matching that required by the PagerBar, the only message reported is the "NotOne" failure from fluid.container - with message "A single container element was not found for selector object Object".&#x20;

In this case, the selector has **already** been evaluated by the DOM binder at top level, and returned an empty list \[] to be fed to the subcomponent options, filtered through initSubcomponents - as it stands, there is no way to "tunnel" any useful contextual information through that might indicate why the selector was evaluated.
