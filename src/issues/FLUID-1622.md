Tab order incorrect after reordering an image. After reordering the images pressing tab will take you to the component's container or to the last image you reordered.

steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Image Reorderer demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/html/imageReorderer.html>

2\) Reorder the images using either the mouse or the keyboard

3\) Using the keyboard press the "tab"

Notice that you are put on the reorderer's container or back onto the same element that you just moved.
