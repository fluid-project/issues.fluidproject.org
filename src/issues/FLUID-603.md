Dragging and dropping a portlet on top of a Lightbox orderable is different in IE7 than it is in FF2.

In FF2, dropping a portlet on top of a Lightbox orderable doesn't do anything, despite a drop target being shown.\
In IE7, dropping a portlet on top of a Lightbox orderable yields proper behaviour (drops in position indicated by marker).
