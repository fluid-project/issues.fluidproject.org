In some cases (presumably, where a component inherits from fluid.modelComponent via multiple paths), the special members "model" and "modelRelay" may accumulate multiple copies of their expander definitions, causing them to initialise multiple times. Particularly devastating is if there is a modelListeners block which will then register its listeners multiple times.

This is caused by the numerous faults described in FLUID-5800 - see also FLUID-5668 for other faults with "members". We don't have a choice but to move to some C3-like system which ensures that material inherited in a grade hierarchy is accepted just once from the same parent grade.
