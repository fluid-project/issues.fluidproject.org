At DEEP 2017, one of the SJRK partners asked: "Will the stories in the storytelling tool be available in one place or will they be distributed?"

ConsiderÂ potential sharing and distributing options. E.g. RSS feed, linking via social media, etc.

What are ways for pushing the story out into the world more generally?

Some sort of public API?
