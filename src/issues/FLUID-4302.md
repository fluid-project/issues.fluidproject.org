The following revision of ErrorsView\.js (now outdated) shows a construct that was led to confusion:

<https://github.com/jhung/infusion/blob/9e8ae1fb32dac30a0c0170676a3cc343fca994b5/src/webapp/components/uploader/js/ErrorsView.js>

```java
fluid.demands("fluid.uploader.errorsView", "fluid.uploader.multiFileUploader", {
        container: "{multiFileUploader}.options.selectors.errorsPanel", // TODO: Why can't I bind to {multiFileUploader}.dom.errors?
        options: {            
            listeners: {
                "{multiFileUploader}.events.afterFileDialog": "{errorsView}.refreshView"
            }
        }
    });
```

Due to ambiguous resolution of "errorsView" this quietly caused a binding of the listener onto the wrong target. \[This doesn't match what I remember of the original problem but is the only possible problem I can see right now - Colin, can you add details?]
