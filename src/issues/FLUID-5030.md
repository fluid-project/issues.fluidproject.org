This shows that actually none of the material in \"fluid.tests.fluid5030Grade\" is reaching the component, not just the \"createOnEvent\" annotation.\n"

Example:

A component has an additive grade defined:

fluid.defaults("fluid.tests.fluid5030Root", {\
gradeNames: \["fluid.eventedComponent", "fluid.tests.fluid5030Grade", "autoInit"],\
...\
});

The grade component defines its own events and a subcomponent with a createOnEvent being one of these own events:

fluid.defaults("fluid.tests.fluid5030Grade", {\
gradeNames: \["fluid.tests.fluid5030Root", "autoInit"],\
events: {\
myevent: null\
},\
components: {\
subComponent: {\
createOnEvent: "myevent"\
}\
}\
...\
});

Create an instance of "fluid.tests.fluid5030Root"; in this instance, \
1\. the "myevent" is not found\
2\. the "subComponent" is created regardless of whether or not its createOnEvent is fired.

The test case to demonstrate this issue: <https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5010/src/webapp/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2763-2802>
