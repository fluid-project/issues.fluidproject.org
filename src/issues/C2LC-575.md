Version 5 of react-scripts has been released. Updating to version 5 will address security vulnerabilities in dependencies of our current version of react-scripts (4.0.3).

This version will update a number of dependencies that we use within Weavly, such as Jest. It also drops support for Node v12. We currently run our Netlify deployment on Node 12, and will need to update the Netlify build to Node 14 as part of this work:

<https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/6382c1015b41fd9529439b69e73b4305704a9e96/netlify.toml>

Node 12 reaches end of life in April 2022:

We currently run GitHub CI against Node 12 and Node 14. As part of this task, we can update that to Node 14 and Node 16.
