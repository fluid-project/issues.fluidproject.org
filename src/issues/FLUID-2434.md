At a very small text size, the text is not centered

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the FSS.Text.Size example\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/fss/html/4.fss.text.size.html>

2\) Notice that the very small text, at the top, is not centered (vertically) in the button nor the text field
