The test case Uploader-test.html is failing on my configuration (FF 3.6 on Windows 7) on test 5, Uploader with direct creator function. The immediate report is "Permission denied for \<file://> to create wrapper for object of class UnnamedClass" which is not terribly informative - applying "?notrycatch" to the URL reveals that the error is thrown from HTML5UploaderSupport.js line 272 which does an xhr.open("POST") presumably against the filesystem.
