Reproduce issue by:

1. Visiting <https://www.codelearncreate.org/>
2. Resize window so mobile view is displayed
3. Expand menu by clicking the hamburger icon
4. Logo is hidden – resize browser window to show desktop view
5. Navigation area looks odd with the hidden logo

The reason for [hiding](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-website/blob/master/layouts/partials/nav.html#L12) the logo is so to make room for the menu items and not make it seem confusing or cluttered. There's probably a better way to accomplish this without having to hide the image and run into the issue described above. One possible approach could be playing around with z-index while also changing the width of the header's wrapper.
