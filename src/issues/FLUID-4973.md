Can you produce a failing test or other demonstration to show why this fails?\\\nThanks\n"

      "body": "This issue was observed when testing the upcoming UIOptions branch (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4927#icft=FLUID-4927>) on UIO. It turns out that the issue was intermittent, and triggered by a race condition in the IoC Testing framework, which then tried to invoke fluid.fail. fluid.fail then invoked the new framework utility \"fluid.logActivity\" which then issues a bare call to fluid.applyHostFunction without the implicit checking applied by the guard mentioned in the previous comment. We should just take the opportunity to rationalise this entire area, since there is actually no useful benefit gained by the use of multi-argument console.log on IE8 and IE9 anyway - exactly the same effect could be had by args.join(\"\").\n\nWe should attempt to consider the previous reports of a console.log with type \"function\" but without a working \"apply\" method as apocryphal and see how far we can get before encountering the problems again. I don't see any reference to such a possibility in any of the support discussions (docs, stackoverflow,e tc.) that have been cited\n"

IE8 does not support Function.prototype.bind. It is used in the framework as part of fluid.applyHostFunction. It appears to have been added or modified at this commit:\
<https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/b53ae2769bd042de4a92ef40bcbebabdba79311c>

This stackoverflow post talks about a work around, linking in a MDN article:\
