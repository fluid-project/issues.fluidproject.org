We need to incorporate the Infusion UIO component into the user interface of OER Commons and ensure that content created by the Authoring Tool is correctly transformed by UIO.

This work is to be carried out in a fork of the OER Commons github repo:\
<https://github.com/ISKME/OER-Commons>\
in the 'authoring\_accessibility' branch.
