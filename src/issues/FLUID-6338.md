When trying to install infusion through NPM as a dependency in another project, the install fails because the call to "grunt buildStylus" is missing dependencies. These are all installed for infusion as dev dependencies.

The change originated from the FLUID-6309 PR ( <https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/916> ) and may be needed to CI.
