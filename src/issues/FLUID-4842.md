The framework behaviour on fluid.fail is currently mildly configurable by means of the fluid.pushSoftFailure directive which is currently used in a few test cases - but this isn't sufficient to meet the needs of <http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-44> which requires a fully flexible system. We need to extend the fluid.pushSoftFailure system so that it accepts a function handle in addition to a simple boolean flag, which may be used to bridge to arbitary external framework code (such as that in the GPII request-handling framework)
