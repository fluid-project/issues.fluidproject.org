If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.\n\nSo, a blank default apparently is not enough if what we meant is to keep the user-selected settings forever. We probably should consider to have a default expiry value of 50 years from now.\n"

The bug report from Jonny:

"On my site <[http://abledaccess.com](http://abledaccess.com/)> when I change the display setting via uiOptions in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Opera and IE, then quit each browser, my settings I set have been reset. Same goes with your demo across said browsers, as well. I saw on Colin's computer this behaviour doesn't happen in Firefox, but it happens on my machine in Firefox, as well. But the reset did happen in Safari, Chrome and Opera on his computer. "
