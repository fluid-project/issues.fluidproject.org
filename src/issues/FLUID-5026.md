Currently the transformation system allows you to output two places at once (non-explicity), once by the virtue of return value and once via the outputPath. This causes some confusion and buggy behavior. For example:

"Magnification": {\
"expander": {\
"type": "fluid.model.transform.round",\
"input": {\
"expander": {\
"type": "fluid.model.transform.scaleValue",\
"valuePath": "display.screenEnhancement.magnification",\
"factor": 100\
}\
},\
"outputPath": "value"\
},\
"dataType": {\
"expander": {\
"type": "fluid.model.transform.literalValue",\
"value": "REG\_DWORD"\
}\
}\
}

will result in the following queuedChanges:

\[\
{\
"path": "Magnification",\
"value": 229.99999999999997,\
"sequence": 0\
},\
{\
"path": "Magnification.value",\
"value": 230,\
"sequence": 1\
},\
{\
"path": "Magnification.dataType",\
"value": "REG\_DWORD",\
"sequence": 2\
}\
]

Which in turn means that the end result will be:

Magnification: 229.9999999999997

Which is clearly not what is wanted.
