A listener which is registered via IoC via the "dispatchListener" route (e.g. one registered to an event which was itself injected via IoC) with no other identifying information (e.g. a namespace or function name) cannot be removed. This is because dispatchListener does not apply the standard "impersonateListener" workflow for all listeners which receive wrapping prior to registration. This issue was discovered during the KETTLE-20 error handling work and blocks those fixes.
