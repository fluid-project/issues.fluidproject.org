The avatar is not properly positioned under the cursor. This is actually caused by a bug in jQuery ( <http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/2643> ): jQuery's ui.draggable has a 'cursorAt' option should accomplish this behaviour, but it doesn't work if scroll is turned on (which it is in the Reorderer).  The ticket has actually been assigned now, so we should monitor it, and see if it is resolved soon. In the meantime, we need to find an alternative solution.
