If you are looking for a widget that allows more than one content panel to be open, don't use this. Usually it can be written with a few lines of jQuery instead, something like this:\n\njQuery(document).ready(function(){\\\n$('.accordion .head').click(function() {\\\n$(this).next().toggle();\\\nreturn false;\\\n}).next().hide();\\\n});\n\nOr animated:\n\njQuery(document).ready(function(){\\\n$('.accordion .head').click(function() {\\\n$(this).next().toggle('slow');\\\nreturn false;\\\n}).next().hide();\\\n});\n"

Currently, it looks like the toggle can't be closed manually and is only closed when another category is open.  I thing the behavior we want is for the user to choose when they open and close.  Easier to see should still be the only one open by default but users may want to have everything open and scroll rather than opening and closing all the time.
