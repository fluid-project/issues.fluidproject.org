Based on some feedback we've received, it seems the hover colours used in the top nav do not have sufficient contrast. Greg wrote:

"On the IDI site as well, the hover colour for the main links at the \
top are about 2.2:1. Here I suggest making the hover colours the \
same as the active colours displayed with the Home link top left \
when on the home page.

"The same is true for the orange link 2:1 and the blue link 2:1 in \
the centre 2.6:1

"Minimum should be 4.5:1"
