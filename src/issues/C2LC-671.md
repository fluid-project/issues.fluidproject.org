This is not new in 1.5.

Steps to reproduce:

* Set the character position to A2, facing right
* The URL will contain: s=abb
* Create a program to move the character
* <https://develop-1-5--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.5&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA3s1z&c=abb&d=&s=abb>
* Play the program
* The character will move but the starting point remains at A2
* Tab through the UI
* When we tab through the positioning text fields, the starting position will change to the current character position (D2 for the program above)
* The URL now contains: s=dbb
