Any ideas on how to detect the order?\n"

It could be that this demo is missing a css file, that some other styling is rendering it invisible or etc. It could also be the problem that the reordererable elements are just too close together so the drop marker isn't perceivable.&#x20;\n"

1\. Open up the demo: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/components/reorderer/dynamic/>\
2\. Drag a div to drop to another location;\
3\. The drop target indicator that shows where the div is dropped at doesn't show.

Other reorderer demos such as "image reorderer" (<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/>) or "layout reorderer" (<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/layoutReorderer/>) show drop targets.
