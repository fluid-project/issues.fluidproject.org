This doesn’t happen in all cases but I’ve been able to reproduce it with the following:

 

1. Turn on Narrator and open a fresh instance of Weavly in MS Edge
2. Switch to the deep sea or jungle world
3. With the character starting at A1
4. Add forward 2
5. Add turn right 90˚
6. Add forward 3 
7. Play program
8. Notice it announces the Column header at the end “Capital C”
9. Use the mouse to hover over various buttons, e.g. those in the program panel
10. Notice it announces “Capital C”
