In Safari on desktop:\
On the opening language screen, when the language list is scrolled to one end or the other, the arrow button is disabled and grey. It correctly has no hover style, but if you click on it, there is 'active' styling applied while the mouse button is pressed: the button colours invert and a wide border is applied.
