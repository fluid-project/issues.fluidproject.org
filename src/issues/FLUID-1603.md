There appears to be some really crazy condition whereby IE will \"duplicate\" a DOM node and therefore lead to the keyboard event target not being recognised. This condition will \"go away\" if an alert() is placed in the focus handler. It seems this test failure, despite being extremely disturbing, does not correspond to a real failure. Will continue to investigate.\n"
