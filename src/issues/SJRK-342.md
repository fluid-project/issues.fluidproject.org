Steps to produce the problem:

1\. Set the them to "aihec" in sjrk.storyTelling.server.config.json5;\
2\. Start the SJRK site;\
3\. Open UIO, select a high contrast theme;\
4\. Aihec logos on the header and the home page are still colorful without adapting to the selected high contrast.

See the attached screen shot for the problem.
