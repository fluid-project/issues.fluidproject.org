Break up the fss-reset into multiple files. For example fss-global-reset.css and fss-global-base.css (names are just examples, not necessarily what we will use). The fss-reset file would remain, but would only include information to link in the other two files.Â 

Additionally we would add a contextual/scoped version. This would be similar to how YUI3 has an in-context version. In this case the user would be able to only reset portions of the document, rather than having it affect the entire page when included.
