So far I have found the following plugins, but none are really suited for our needs (as noted below).\n\n* EPubExport Extension works, but hasn't been updated since 2010 and in Beta status (<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EPubExport>)\n* Collection Extension - a stable extension that creates book formats in ODF, PDF, and other formats, except EPUB. (<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Collection>)\n* Collection Extension 2 - appears to support EPUB based on wireframes, but development seems to have stalled? ( <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk:Collection_Extension_2#Great.21_What_is_the_status.3F_18036>)\n* LuciwikEPUB Extension (<http://lucidor.org/luciwik/>) exports to EPUB but is marked as Beta (not much discussion about this extension. Not even sure if it's still active).\n"
