I did the "Test to fail"\
"Test 2: Disconnect Network During Upload"

I uploaded 4 files with 3MB each in a virtual machine. After disconnecting (shutting down WiFi on the Host)\
nothing happens.

Only after reconnecting and waiting for around 45-60 Seconds the server displays that the upload failed.

This only works on the server test. The demo does not recognize the disconnect at all and displays that everything worked well.
