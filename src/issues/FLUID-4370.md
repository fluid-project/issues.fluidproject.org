This shows up clearly on the black on white theme where large portions of the UI still have black backgrounds instead of white. Also the select drop down is styled all in yellow on black. If I remove the fl-preview-theme class from UI Enhancer, things start to work a bit better.\n"

The "Yellow on Black" and "White on Black" contrast themes set some of the text and the icons to be dark grey. This provides a very low contrast and makes it hard to view.

Steps to reproduce

1\) Open any of the UIO demos\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FullNoPreviewUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FullPreviewUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/FatPanelUIOptions/html/uiOptions.html>

2\) Change the contrast to either "Yellow on Black" or "White on Black"\
Notice the dark grey text and icons
