Selected objects/functions/features should have a clear and visible focus state

Description from co-design:&#x20;

* Powerpoint was not an effective tool for the activity, as objects couldn’t be locked in place, and sound and visuals couldn’t be synced, selected objects didn’t have a clear focus state

We could make interactive mockups and developed solutions
