Another pass is required on the Layout Customizer and Reorder in order to compensate for potential CSS-P problems. CSS-P needs to be considered when dropping nodes around the document and those nodes use absolutely/fixed/etc positioning, padding/margins, etc.  and might therefore break out of their containers.
