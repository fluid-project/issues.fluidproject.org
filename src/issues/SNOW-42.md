On the Snow site, the mobile layout and styling of the navigation is confusing.

* It is unclear that the 2nd level of navigation is not controlled by the hamburger menu (they appear as the same blue-green colour).
* Confusing when the top-level menu is open, the hamburger menu changes background colour and top-level menu contents pop-in.
* It's not clear that there is a logical grouping to the 3rd-level navigation. It just looks like site-wide navigation.
