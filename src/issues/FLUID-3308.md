Create a demo app for the FSOSS presentation

This demo app is intended to showcase infusion on the mobile device, highlighting benefits of the infusion framework, FSS, and mobile FSS

The demo app will pull in an html page or some feed of images, and render only the images and some info about them onto the page.
