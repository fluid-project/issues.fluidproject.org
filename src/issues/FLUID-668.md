Due to a bug in IE, opacity only works if the width or height of an element has been set. This is a problem, for example, in the uPortal reordering portlets sample. You will notice that when trying to move a portlet with the keyboard the opacity setting does not work. Other problems with opacity has caused us to set it in code, for example, in the Uploader. I think we need to come up with an opacity strategy that will work in all cases and will simplify the creation of individual components with respect to styling.&#x20;
