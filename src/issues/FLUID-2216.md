UI Options accordion is not displaying/hiding properly&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the UI Options example from the daily build site.\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/templates/UIOptions.html>

2\) Click on "Easier to find"

Notice that "Easier to see" doesn't completely collapse
