Steps to reproduce:

Run the following program in portrait mode:

<https://develop-1-4--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.4&t=default&w=Camping&p=sA8s1zbsB5s1z&c=igdabibibig&d=&s=abb>

When the character moves from row 3 to row 4 a white line appears just above the line between rows 3 and 4. The line disappears after the character has stopped moving. As the character continues to move down, the white line appears just above the line above the position the character has moved to. This does not happen in the columns before ‘I’.&#x20;

The issue seem to be caused by rounding issues for the values we used for starting SVG rectangle of the character, we decided to update the height and width of the starting cell to be 0.25.
