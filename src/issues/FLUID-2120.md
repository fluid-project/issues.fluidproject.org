When the font size is increased the "Edit Appearance" text is no longer bound within the button

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sakai mock-up example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/shared/sakai/sakai.html#>

2\) Click on "Edit Appearance"&#x20;

3\) Change the font size to +5, save the changes, and close the dialog

Notice that "Edit Appearance" text is outside of the button boundaries
