If the same listener function was hooked up for multiple model paths, such as:

var listenerToFire = function () {\
....\
};

applier.modelChanged.addListener("path1", listenerToFire);\
applier.modelChanged.addListener("path2", listenerToFire);

When change requests are issued for both "path1" and "path2", rather than having the listener function being triggered twice, only the change request on "path2" is triggered, which leads to an impression that only the last call was registered successful.
