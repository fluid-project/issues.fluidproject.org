When the transcripts are used to navigate to different areas of the video, the different language transcripts are not kept well in sync with each other: If a certain phrase is used to navigate, then switching languages should show the user the same phrase (albeit in the other language). This does not always happen.

To reproduce:

1\. Open the English transcript.\
2\. Play the video until one of the transcript phrases is highlighted.\
3\. Pause the video.\
4\. Click on a phrase near the beginning of the transcript (e.g. the 3rd or 4th phrase).\
Confirm that the video scrubs to the right place.\
5\. Switch to the French captions.\
6\. Click on a phrase near the END of the transcript.\
Confirm that the video scrubs to the right place.\
7\. Switch back to the English transcript.

Note that the transcript window scrolls to show the near-the-beginning phrase highlighted. It should probably be updated to be the same phrase as was just selected in the French transcript.
