List number of moved item disappears while reorderering a sortable list

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the Reorderer Springboard example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/fluid-components/html/Reorderer.html>

2\) In example 1 move any of the sortable list items

Notice that the number for the item you moved disappears while you are reordering it
