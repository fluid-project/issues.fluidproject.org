Can't click on non-standard text to open the rich text inline edit

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the rich text inline edit example: <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/rich/demo.html>

2\) Attempt to add in a non-standard unicode character (example here: <http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols.html> )

3\) After saving the edit, attempt to re-open edit mode by clicking on the non-standard text.

Notice that you are unable to re-open it in edit mode. If you click just to the right of the non-standard text, it will open.
