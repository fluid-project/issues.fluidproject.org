A perma comment can be used to keep a comment from being stripped out by the minifier. I believe the syntax is just to have \*! in front. (see jQuery's code for how to implement). We should put this at the top of the first linked file to place a comment over all of the Infusion code.&#x20;

It's probably adequate to have the comment as something such as the following:

Fluid Infusion vX.X.X
