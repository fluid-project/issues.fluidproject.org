We have started [meeting to discuss our architecture (and I would also say our technical governance)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyeLVG6Sk0uguth7TplK4gsPUQWVJ_aFoYpXWQtLRnY/edit#).  To support this effort, we agreed that I would restructure and lightly expand the existing documents we have such as CONTRIBUTE.md.  These would be moved to a new docs directory.

In this directory would be guidance about the technologies we use, code conventions, contribution guidelines, et cetera.  We also discussed making a place to record key architectural decisions, which would be structured as [Architectural Decision Records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md), or "ADRs".  These would live in docs/adr.  Simon proposed naming ADRs in the order they are created, with three digits for starters.  Although I would not create an ADR as part of this initial work, I would make the ADR directory along with a README.md explaining the concept in light detail.
