I'm attempting to implement the following scenario for InlineEdit and finding that I'm missing some hooks to do it.&#x20;

While actually editing an inlineEditable item, hide the Undo/Redo links for that item. \[The reason for this is two fold: 1) Reduce clutter. 2) Undo and Redo are ambiguous while actually editing.]&#x20;

I should like, at the time that I specify the fluid.undoDecorator as a componentDecorator for inlineEdit, to be able to specify which inlineEdit events I want Undo to listen to and what I want to fire when the event happens.&#x20;
