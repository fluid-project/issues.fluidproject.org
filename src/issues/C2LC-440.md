Map previous world values to the new worlds:

* Default -> Sketchpad
* Rabbit (Forest) -> Jungle
* Rocket (Space) -> Space

Changing the world will have the following effects:

* Change the scene background; 3 themes variations for each background:
  * Default (default theme, light theme, dark theme)
  * Grayscale (grayscale theme)
  * High Contrast (high contrast theme)
* Change the character appearance
* Starting position (probably all A2)
* Grid line colour; 3 theme variations as above for scene background
* Line drawing colour (probably same as grid line colour)
* Character background colour

We should also increase the line drawing thickness across all worlds and themes.
