This includes sketching of workflows and mockups for the toolkit site, as well as the workflow of a step-by-step guide for creating a cooperative for 5 scenarios including freelancers, existing worker co-ops, unions, policy makers and startups.

Some considerations: 

* engaging different users immediately including those who want to start a co-op, those who want to join, those who want to learn about cooperativism etc
* de-fragmentation of what already exists - bringing together resources, map
* designs and sketches shown are starting points for co-design of the user experience
