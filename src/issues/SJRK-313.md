Reported by @@Dana:\
I added Silvia’s MOOCs resource to the Learning Tools section, and TIG’s SDG guide to the Inclusive Design Guides sections - but as you can see, this caused both of the sections to change their location in the list order, so what used to be:\
Youth Activism\
Inclusive Design Guides\
Inclusive Design Practice\
Storytelling\
Learning to Learn\
Learning Tools\
Content Customization Tools\
Inclusive Policy and Strategy\
Youth Leadership

Is now:\
Youth Activism\
Inclusive Design Practice\
Storytelling\
Learning to Learn\
Content Customization Tools\
Inclusive Policy and Strategy\
Inclusive Design Guides\
Learning Tools\
Youth Leadership

Could you please fix the category order back to what it was?
