We currently have a demo branch <https://github.com/michelled/videoPlayer/tree/demo> that needs to go into the project repo master. There are several outstanding issues that need to be fixed before this branch can be merged. They are linked to this issue.&#x20;

There are many issues that have already been fixed in this branch:&#x20;

and many details that were refined within these issues including:&#x20;

* scrub bar is missing
* where's the volume slider?
* fix or remove full screen mode
* scrubber time obscures the captions (captions should move up)
* increasing line spacing makes it really difficult to select a caption or transcript language
* Make captions respond correctly to UIO FLUID-4613
* french captions in the demo
* videos loading the same captions file
* make captions off by default
* captions should not be flush against the bottom of the video
* Concat all captions into a transcript
* Highlight sections as they play
* If we have time, implement clickability
* Ghost transcript bug (scrub around a bit and then release the transcripts continues to move around for a while)
* make transcripts off by default
* transcript and scroll bar extend slightly beyond the container
* closing the transcript should not leave a grey background behind
* styling the new UIO panel
* render the slider in the UIO panel
* Triage the styling branches
* Apply styles to the demo branch
* check if there are bigger videos
* tests are throwing errors - one issue is that simulate was reintroduced
* increasing text size and line spacing makes the captions go beyond the container
* increasing the size makes the transcript go beyond the container
* working menu button for language selection (triage AC's or use Filaments)
* icons for captions and transcripts when they are on
* the scrubber and handle has odd styling in the high contrast themes
* volume slider does not show properly in high contrast themes
* multiple quick hovers cause ghosting of appearance/disappearance of controls
* selecting the already select option does not hide the menu for transcripts and captions
* volume slider should be above scrubbing handle
* volume slider needs a background - too easy to have it disappear when trying to change the volume
* change pull down to 'Learner Options'
* make captions and transcripts styling (size etc.) respond to modifications in UIO
* high contrast themes remove the border of the video player
* styling the transcript
* make the videos larger on startup of the demo
* Mammals page. captions are ON even though they should not be. It seems like a timing issue since a breakpoint in the script will make the videoPlayer captions to behave as expected.
* pausing the video with both captions and transcripts showing and then clicking on a different section in the transcript causes two captions to appear in the caption area.
* next transcript link isn't clickable
* implement a hacky Video Enhancer
* the UIO media panel setting and the captions menu setting are no in sync. To reproduce, set captions on in the UIO panel. Now try to turn captions off in the video player. You will need to open the menu twice in order to do so.
* controllers tests are failing
* media panel integration is not on the VideoPlayer.html demo
* labels in the menus should have just the language name
* vertical gradient on video watched indicator (darker yellow on the bottom)
* increase text size on scrubber handle, add equal padding on all sides
* fix the colour of the volume slider and background
