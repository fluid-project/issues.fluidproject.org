It will require at least an extra step when building any war file that depends on Fluid, since you'll need to run the ant target and then build your dependencies. I'm going to look more into Ant/Maven integration, but we may be able to achieve most of the desired effect with the following structure:\n\nsrc\\\nwebapp\\\nfluid-components\\\ncss\\\nhtml\\\nimages\\\njs\\\nWEB-INF/\\\ntests\\\nsample-code\\\nbuild-scripts\n\nAnd then the Ant build can produce the final structure as above for distribution.\n"

This would mean that if our tests and sample code work in one structure, it will not work in the other.\n\nAn idea was to use Ant's Filter & Token task to change the paths in the test and sample code files during execution of the ant build script. However, this will not work because Ant only replaces a token embedded in the file with a specified value in the Ant script. Hence we will not be able to replace the paths we want unless we place tokens (like @replaceMe@) into the path itself, which makes such paths unusable for most purposes.\n\nAnastasia suggested something like sed to do string replacement, but this will not work on Windows. There could be other alternatives like finding a suitable Ant task to plug in.\n\nPerhaps it will be easier to decide on a structure that will be the same for both work and build versions.\n"

Currently, the bundles we ship for deployment of Fluid 0.1 (the component-templates directory and the fluid-components-0.1.war)  also contain all our unit tests as well. We should split these out from the deployment artifact so we're not shipping non-production code in the actual package.

So, in other words, the deployment package for Fluid should only contain material that needs to be deployed to the web server directly:

1\. Fluid JavaScript and its dependencies (jQuery, etc)\
2\. CSS\
3\. Static (ie. non templates) HTML documents\
4\. Images used by the components themselves, but not as sample data

So we'll want to move unit tests, Lightbox.html, the fruit images, and the entire tests directory to a separate spot.
