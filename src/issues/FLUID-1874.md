Uploading files while there are previously uploaded files in the file queue, makes the uploader appear to halt

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uploader example:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>

2\) Add some files to the file queue and upload them

3\) Add some other files to the file queue and upload them

Notice that the uploader appears to halt after uploading all of the new files.
