Until that time, if we do hit a breakage in the code, I like the idea of being able to debug it quickly. I suppose it speaks to the untested and non-production qualities of the code in question.&#x20;\n"

There are some console.log() commands in VideoPlayer\_framework.js and VideoPlayer\_uiOptions.js that don't work in IE unless the console is open. If the console is not open, the video player doesn't instantiate. We should convert these to fluid.log() statements.
