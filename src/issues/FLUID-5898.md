"Since the beginning of time", the IoC reference resolution system has triggered a hard failure when resolving a reference with a nonempty path whose context doesn't match. Unfortunately the new "fast path" implemented for FLUID-5249, <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-5796#icft=FLUID-5796> uses inconsistent semantics and simply returns "undefined" for some resolution cases. For example, the following listener

```javascript
{
                    // TODO: Replace this with some progressive enhancement action.
                    priority: "last",
                    funcName: "flock.webAudio.outputManager.iOSStart",
                    args: [
                        "{that}",
                        "{audioSystem}.context",
                        "{scriptProcessor}.node", // Resolves to undefined, doesn't error.
                    ]
                }
```

is capable of delivering `undefined` as the 3rd argument where {scriptProcessor} fails to match as a context.
