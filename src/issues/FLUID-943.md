Adding more than 1 file to the Upload queue, causes the pop-up version of uploader to scroll out of site, within its container.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the pop-up version of the Uploader from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/uploader/pop-up/index.html>

2\) add four or more files. Notice that you can no longer see the "Cancel' and "Upload' buttons

3\) Click one of the  'x' to remove a file.

4\) tap the shift-tab key. Notice that when the "Cancel' or "Upload" button has focus, the Uploader's title bar move out of view.
