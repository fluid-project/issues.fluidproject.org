Shower time of recent weeks has suggested that it ought to be possible to eliminate the requirement to "dedupe" multiple instances of Infusion from a module tree, by means of some semi-ingenious behaviour at module load time. Scribbling on pieces of paper suggests that issuing node's "resolve" algorithm for the directory 3 levels in the hierarchy above the current Infusion's root should pick up any infusion resolvable by outer scoped modules. If we find such a n Infusion, we can just assign it to module.exports and return - and the same algorithm will cascade hierarchically. If we find no such infusion, we must be the highest, and proceed with normal initialisation.
