User loses text selection in the content area when tabs backwards. Headings/subheadings are converted into editable inputs whenever they get a focus and therefore they remove text selection in the editable area.\
Also since not every button has a key shortcut and there are no landmarks in Write Step users might want to tab backwards to use write toolbar buttons
