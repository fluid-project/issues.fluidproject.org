With a checkbox focused in the builder, pressing Enter activates Select All which leads to a confusing situation.

To reproduce:\
1\. Load the builder: <http://forge.fluidproject.org/infusionBuilder/html/InfusionBuilder.html>\
2\. Press tab until the checkbox for Infusion Framework Core gets focus styling.\
3\. Press Enter.\
4\. Notice all items become selected, and the focus styling moves to "Select All".

Appears in IE8, FF3.6 not affected.
