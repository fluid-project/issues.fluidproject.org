Pausing a video causes the scrubber to jump backward in time a little. Unpausing continues the video at the proper time however.

It appears this happens when you have scrubbed the bar manually - the pause scrubber will jump back to where you last scrubbed to.

To reproduce:

* Load <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Scrub the video forward (i.e. 1:00)
* Play the video for a few seconds
* Pause the video
* Notice the scrubber bar jumps back to 1:00
* Scrub the video to 0:30
* Play the video for a few seconds
* Pause the video
* Notice the scrubber bar jumps back to 0:30
