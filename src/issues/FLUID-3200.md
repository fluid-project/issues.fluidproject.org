Currently the mkdir function in php seems to create directories with a permission of d-wxr----t - this is not ideal, as I cannot delete the files or remove the directory without writing a php script to do so. While this is not a critical issue, it is something that should be resolved, so that the fluid user can delete the cached files when we want a refreshed copy.
