As [discussed in Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!JcoHDrfLedPQdFhAXn:matrix.org/$d6qZpxyofOE0Vw64pi9uqPSHeXRScFYVQUDjPQcl8Hw?via=matrix.org) it would be helpful to only run the full test suite in Github Actions if Infusion code is modified. Skipping tests for docs updates (for example) would significantly reduce our usage of Github Actions minutes.
