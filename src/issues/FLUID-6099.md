It's easy to accidentally create a fluid.test.testCaseHolder "modules" specification structure that isn't quite properly formed. I accidentally wrote something like this, for example, where I omitted the "tests" block:

```java
fluid.defaults("flock.test.badTester", {
    gradeNames: "fluid.test.testCaseHolder,

    modules: [
        {
             sequence: [
                 {
                     func: "QUnit.ok",
                     args: [true]
                 }
             ]
        }
    ]
});
```

In this case, no errors or warnings are raised, and the test case passes with "0 of 0 tests run."

Perhaps one option, instead, is to fail in the case that we encounter no tests? Or provide some kind of validation for test specifications? This is obviously a case of user error, but would be helpful to provide them with some guidance if we can.
