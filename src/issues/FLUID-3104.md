The progressive enhancement features we have tentatively planned for a future release of Infusion provide a concrete implementation of a system for matching the the environment with a user's preferences for their UI. We'd like to generalize this implementation into a specification for how to enable user interface adaptations. Next step is to sketch out a generic architecture for how this can be accomplished within the AccessForAll spec.
