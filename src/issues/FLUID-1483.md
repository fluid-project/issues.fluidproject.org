Moving an item in the lightbox causes a selection box to be displayed around the lightbox.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the lighbox demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/generic-lightbox/generic-lightbox.html>

2\) Move one of the images. Notice the blue border that is place around the lightbox. It may only be visible on the top and/or sides.
