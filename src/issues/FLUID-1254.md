These goals are at a high level. Problem statement, pain points and known use cases, user scenarios will help help identify goals.

Thinking through how we can rectify identified pain points will help define these goals. For example: Pain point might be "high cognitive load placed on user to remember original information before they edited it in the case they want to go back to original ". A design goal might be, "let the system remember and remind user of information versions".

Design goals should be documented on the wiki in the component design space.
