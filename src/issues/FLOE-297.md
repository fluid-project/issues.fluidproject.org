Currently there are two settings for speak text. The turn voice on/off which handles the self voicing of the first discovery tool itself, and the speak text adjuster which handles self voicing / screen reading of the system. The two options have been found to be confusing for users. A first approach at removing this confusion is to link them together so that the two controls affect both the tools self voicing and the systems.
