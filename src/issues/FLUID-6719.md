In 2.0 era releases, the build scripts produced both minified and uncompressed bundles. The minified bundles were called things like dist/infusion-all.min.js, and the uncompressed bundles were called things like dist/infusion-all.js.

In replacing the build scripts in the run up to 3.0, we moved to only producing minified bundles, but gave them the uncompressed file used previously. We should mention this in the migration notes document.
