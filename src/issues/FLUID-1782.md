The undo/redo button overlaps the text, in display mode, when the text is too long to be displayed on a single line

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the bSpace example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Edit the text in one of the inline edit fields with some long text that will be on two lines when in display mode

Notice that the undo button is displayed over top of the text on the first line.
