When you are viewing an individual image, the only link option available is to AddImages, which takes you to <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImage/>

There should be a link that takes you back to the image library, and the AddImages link should probably go to <http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/> ?
