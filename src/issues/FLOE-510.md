Currently there is not a convenient way to add internationalization / custom strings to the Wordpress UIO plugin.

Ideally internationalization and custom strings can be done through the WP admin interface, and use WP's internationalization capabilities.

The types of strings you would want to be able to customize would be:

* labels
* descriptions
* values
* any screen reader accessible text
