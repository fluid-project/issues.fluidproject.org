To reproduce:

1. Go to <https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/>
2. Click "show preferences", increase text size or line space
3. Refresh the page
4. Try to click "show preferences" but it becomes unclickable

Another related issue is, the text "Co-designing Inclusive Cities" on the banner is stretched out of the top of the page. It seems this behavior covers on top of the "show preferences" link and makes the link unclickable.
