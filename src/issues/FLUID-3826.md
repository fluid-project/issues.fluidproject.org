At the moment, it's difficult for us to freely change component options without breaking backwards compatibility with older versions of Infusion. Fortunately, options are just JSON data, so we should be able to provide some automatic framework features for transforming old component options into the new formats.

The idea here is to take Engage's prototype model transformation features and move them into Infusion core.
