The new recursive implementation of instantiator.clearComponent has a substandard implementation which makes an assumption that every traversed element is a component. This assumption is not true in general - component trees may contain arbitrary non-component material, assuming typeName and id are missing.

(13:22:01) Isle of Yura: fluid.each(child.options.components, function(gchild, gchildname) { 10966                that.clearComponent(child, gchildname);   10967            }); \
(13:22:16) Isle of Yura: so child is not really a component ðŸ™‚\
(13:22:25) Isle of Yura: it's a function that 	returns an object\
(13:22:29) Isle of Yura: so it has no options
