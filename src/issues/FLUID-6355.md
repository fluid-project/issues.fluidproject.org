Currently Infusion-Icons contains a set of custom made svgs glyphs for use when compiling custom fonts. We should make the free font awesome glyphs available as well to make it easier to compile custom icon fonts that include them.

font awesome in particular is mentioned here because they are a popular icon set that is provided with an open license.
