The storySpeaker component (a fluid.textToSpeech) stops working in Microsoft Edge if the browser tests are run first. This issue does not occur in Chrome 76 or Firefox 68 in the same environment.

To reproduce:\
1\. Run the webserver\
2\. Run the browser tests to their completion (close any file upload dialogs): <http://localhost:8081/tests/>\
3\. Open the example story: <http://localhost:8081/storyView.html?id=storyExample>\
4\. Click the "Listen to my story" button (the green loudspeaker icon)

Expected:\
The title, author, keywords and contents of the story are read aloud

Actual:\
Silence, nothing happens

Commenting out the "volume: 0" specification in the page tests will solve the issue, but then the tests may be briefly audible, which is not ideal. Explore alternative solutions.
