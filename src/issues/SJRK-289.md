Add the ability to auto-save or cache story content on the user's local machine in order to mitigate server issues or losses due to accidental refreshing or otherwise.

**Update**\
Given limitations on storing large files locally (as mentioned in Cindy Li's comment below), the new approach will be to auto-save the story and any associated files on the server.
