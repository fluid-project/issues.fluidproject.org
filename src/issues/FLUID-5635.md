Antranig made the following suggestions for grouping the Infusion documentation table of contents:\
The current split of some material into "Infusion" and others into "API" doesn't make too much sense. Certainly whatever top-level grouping we have, material such as "ChangeApplier API" should go together with "Events", "IoC", "Framework API", etc.

I suggest that we have one area called "Infusion" or "Framework" which includes

* everything currently in "Infusion", plus ChangeApplier API, Framework API, DOM Binder API

Another area called "Components" which includes

* everything else currently in API - that is, everything from "Inline Edit" down to "Table of Contents".

I suggest we do away with the top-level name "API" since we don't really believe in having APIs anyway.

We should either put "Preferences Framework" in a top-level grouping of its own, or else at the bottom of the "Framework" area or the top of the "Components" area to emphasise that it lives at a special level of abstraction - it is less abstract than all the rest of the "framework", but more abstract than any component.
