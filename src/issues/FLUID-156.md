Commits to the sandbox area of the fluid SVN should not be subject to the rule that a JIRA item number is required in the commit message:

Your log message does not contain a JIRA Issue identifier or 'NOJIRA'... (or bad format used)\
The JIRA Issue identifier or 'NOJIRA' must be the first item on the first line of the log message.
