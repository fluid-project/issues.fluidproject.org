Right now, the ToggleButton fires an onPress event, but nothing listens to it, and the event does not trigger the change of state. It might be better to factor this such that click and keyboard activation trigger the onPress and the onPress triggers the model changed. This would open up a hook for prevention of the change of state, for example.
