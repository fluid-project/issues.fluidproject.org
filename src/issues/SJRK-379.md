When moving to the story preview part of the Story Edit page, if the story contains a non-empty audio or video block, the following error is reported:

```javascript
"Assertion failure - check console for more details: Could not resolve reference {that}.dom.mediaPlayer.0 to a value"
```

No issues seem to be present otherwise, the preview is working as expected, and publishing works without issue. I am unsure how long this bug has been present.

**To reproduce:**

1. Go toÂ <https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html>
2. Click "Add an audio block" or "Add a video block"
3. Add an appropriate file to the block
4. Click "Continue"
5. Click "Preview my story"

**Expected:**

The story preview is displayed and no errors are thrown

**Actual:**

The story preview is displayed and the error described above is thrown
