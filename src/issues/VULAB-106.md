OK, received.  I can follow the issue through JIRA, no problem

Here's the issue as per Colin's e-mail

VULab is a deliverable of the Fluid Project lead by a team at York University. York has purchased a dedicated server for VULab development and testing, since the software does involve a fair amount of video storage.

We'd like to make VULab welcome as a full part of our community and build environment. We'd like to start by hosting this machine on the fluidproject.org domain as "vulab.fluidproject.org."
