The code at <https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/b3edd48025a7b02981cc97fbec1eda61ab15becb/src/webapp/components/uiOptions/js/FatPanelUIOptions.js>  will fail, with the following message:

ASSERTION FAILED: Error in initDependent: user instantiator supplied with id 11 which differs from that for currently active instantiation with id 13 while instantiating dependent component with name "markupRenderer" with record Object { type="fluid.renderIframe", container="{fatPanelUIOPtionsImp}.dom.iframe", options={...}} as child of Object { typeName="fluid.fatPanelUIOPtionsImp", id=6, more...}

This looks like it is caused by improper nesting of instantiator use within initDependents
