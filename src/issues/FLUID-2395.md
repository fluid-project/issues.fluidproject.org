remove the use of activedescendent in the reorderer

Here are some links explaining the use of activedescendent

<http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/#aria-activedescendant>\
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#focus_activedescendant>

Here is a link for how to do the same thing without activedescendant, which seems to be the way we are already doing things\
