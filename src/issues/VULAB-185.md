To streamline our testing process, we need to create a set of workflows for testers to follow that are clear but not hold hands too much.\
We do not want the "natural" or intuitive flow of vulab to be controller, merely the goals that the users are trying to accomplish.

I'll create a google document and we'll get something draft.
