To reproduce:

1\. Visit <http://build.fluidproject.org:8080/sakai-imagegallery2-web/site/AddImages/>\
2\. Upload a set of images\
3\. Upload the same set of images again\
4\. In the Flash-based uploader, the user receives a "File upload error", but in the HTML5-based uploader, the user successfully uploads the existing files.
