Set up deployment of the "production" branch of <https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment> to a static site host at <https://build.codelearncreate.org/>

The application is a React web app and can be built with `npm run build` with the `CI` environment variable set. We have a CI build configured using GitHub Actions with more details:

<https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/dev-0.1/.github/workflows/ci.yaml>

The smallest amount of work would be to reuse what we have currently for <https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/>

* Jenkins job with web hook configured in <https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-exploratory>
* Builds the static site with Node.js
* Deploys to a Docker container that we host

We could also look at triggering Jenkins from GitHub Actions (rather than web hook) or at deploying to Netlify from GitHub Actions.
