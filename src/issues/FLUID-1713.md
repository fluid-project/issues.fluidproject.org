We need an event that will signal the user when the whole batch of files is finished being uploaded. afterUploadComplete is a good name, however it's already being used mistakenly when a file is complete. Here's a proposal for reworking the events in Uploader 2:

onFileSuccess: when a file has been successfully uploaded\
onFileComplete: when a file is fully completely uploaded\
onUploadComplete: when the whole batch of files is complete
