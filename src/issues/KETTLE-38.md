The dataSource implementation relies simply on the typeName of the overall concrete grade in order to compute the "writable" version of the grade:

```javascript
getWritableGrade: {
            funcName: "kettle.dataSource.getWritableGrade",
            args: ["{that}.options.writable", "{that}.typeName"]
        }
```

This is always faulty since the grade's "principal type" is always an essentially random selection from the many gradeNames on offer.
