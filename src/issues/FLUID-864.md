You are able to tab around, but the jQuery tabs to the left of the last moved jQuery tab will not get focus. Pressing shift-tab will only cycle through the jQuery tabs to the left of and including the last moved jQuery tab.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) open the reorderable jQuery tab page from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/jquery-tabs/jquery-tabs.html>

2\) tap the "tab" key until one of the reorderable jQuery tabs gets focus.

3\) use the keyboard (ctrl-arrow) to move the tab.

4\) press the tab key and notice that it never touches the jQuery tabs to the left of the one that was moved.

5\) press shift-tab and notice that it will only cycle through the jQuery tabs to the left of and including the one that was moved
