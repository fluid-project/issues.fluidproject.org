Behaviour of ChromeVox:

* On React-Bootstrap Modal: Content on the modal component is not spoken by ChromeVox. Role of the modal wrapper is set to dialog and has aria-modal property set to "true"
* On React-modal: Content on the modal component is spoken by ChromeVox after a long information about the page. Role of the modal wrapper is set to nothing, but the modal box's role is set to dialog without aria-modal property&#x20;
* On Material-ui: Content on the modal component is spoken by ChromeVox right away. Role of the modal is set to presentation, with aria-labelledby set to the id of the modal's heading and aria-describedby set to the id of the modal's main content
* What's suggested on w3 (<https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/alertdialog.html):> use role of alertDialog with aria-labelledby and aria-describedby&#x20;
