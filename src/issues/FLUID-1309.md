Hover text appears below the table of data, instead of under the pointer.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the bSpace example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/section-info/section-info.html>

2\) Place the pointer over top of one of the inline edit fields. Notice that after a couple of seconds the hover message appears below table instead of directly under the pointer.
