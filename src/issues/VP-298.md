We would like to use the Video Player to host videos on the SNOW site. SNOW uses Drupal, and we do not yet have Drupal integration, so we will set up a WordPress site with the Video Player WordPress plugin, and host SNOW videos there. The site will have minimal theming to make it look consistent with the SNOW site, but will not have a full-blown SNOW theme.
