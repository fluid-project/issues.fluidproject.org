The font size used for the checkboxes in the UIO panels is too small. They should be a size corresponding to 14pt ( <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+UI+Options+Design+High+Fidelity%2C+C.1#Style> ). I had attempted to change these with the FLUID-5002 fix, but it seems that in doing so the size of the ToC toggle increases and the panel for the "Links & Buttons" settings expands to accomodate the text. These should be kept consistent with the current sizes if possible.
