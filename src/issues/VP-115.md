      "body": "It is not exactly the behavior. It seems that videoPlayer tend to occupy all the given space to it, which is the whole window. Therefore we see this effect when video is shown on a full screen and then resizes itself. It is still not a good effect which probably would be especially visible in case if we have a page with multiple videos inside of relative big divs, during page initialization I would see this weird resizing...\n\nMaybe as a solution we should resize and define videoPlayer sizes based on the given videos right before rendering it... if it possible\n"

Got from branch <https://github.com/cindyli/videoPlayer/tree/FLUID-4587-4546>\
On the page /demos/VideoPlayer.html

The effect is clearly visible when FireBug is on.
