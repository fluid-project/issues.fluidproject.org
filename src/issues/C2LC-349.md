The movement sounds are "pitched" based on the row they're in. With our current tuning, every three rows should be a new octave.

In working on C2LC-256, I noticed that although we should travel over a range of five octaves (row 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13) moving from top to bottom, we only hit four. I suspect the initial pitch algorithm wasn't updated when the scene size changed.

Looking at the diagram generated in the tests, I see that it still tries to account for "out of bounds", and stops at row 12, so it makes sense that it would never play the next lower octave at row 13 or beyond.
