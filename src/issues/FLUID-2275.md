At the moment, the jquery.tinymce plugin invokes the following code immediately upon being parsed:

// Invoke this immediately to prime TinyMCE.\
tinyMCE.init({\
mode: "none",\
theme: "simple"\
});

However, to properly be included in Fluid-all.js, the plugin should not assume that TinyMCE is present, in case a user is using Fluid-all.js without being interested in TinyMCE-related code.

The correct implementation should be:

if (typeof(tinyMCE) !== "undefined") {\
// Invoke this immediately to prime TinyMCE.\
tinyMCE.init({\
mode: "none",\
theme: "simple"\
});\
}
