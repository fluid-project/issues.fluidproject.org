If you select a block of text, including an inline edit field, and click on that inline edit field, the selection highlighting remains.&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the inline edit demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/inline-edit/announcements/announcements.html>

2\) Drag your mouse across a block of text and Notice the highlighting

3\) Click on an inline edit field. Notice the highlighting remains over the inline edit field
