If there is only one language available for the transcript, the grey box at the top still shows a dropdown menu. If there is only one language to choose from why have a menu? It just adds clutter.

It is not obvious to me how to get rid of this dropdown menu and treat the language available as the "default".

A temporary workaround could be providing information in the documentation pointing web content developers to where in the code the dropdown box is located and can be commented out.
