Steps to reproduce:

1\. Open any of the UIO/Prefs Framework Demos (e.g. <http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/> )\
2\. Open the preferences panel and change the contrast\
3\. Close and re-open the panel so that the preferences are applied to it

Notice that the contrast settings aren't applied to the slider
