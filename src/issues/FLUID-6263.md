To produce the problem:

1. Go to <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/fullPagePanelStyle/>
2. Turn on "table of content"
3. Refresh the page
4. The page is not loaded and the console shows the javascript error:

```java
ASSERTION FAILED:  Instantiation of view component with type fluid.tableOfContents.levels failed, since selector " .flc-toc-tocContainer " did not match any markup in the document
```

To get around this issue in the browser:

1. Open the browser preferences page;
2. Rremove the cookie from "build.fluidproject.org" and named "fluid-ui-settings".
