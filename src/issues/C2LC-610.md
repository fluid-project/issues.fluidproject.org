Two digit loop iteration counters are cut off on the ipad display and it's difficult to change the number of loop iterations on the ipad.

 

After QA discussion we decided to make the field slightly wider and have it be a numeric input so that it brings up the number key pad on iOS instead of the alphanumeric keypad.
