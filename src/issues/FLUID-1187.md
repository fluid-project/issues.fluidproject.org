When you place the pointer over the title bar of a movable portlet, it takes a little bit longer for the cursor to change. This means that if you are attempting to move portlets quickly, you can miss picking it up when you starting DnD.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the uPortal example from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/portal/portal.html>

2\) Place the pointer over the title bar of a movable portlet. Notice there is a brief delay before the cursor changes style.
