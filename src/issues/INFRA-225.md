The mechanisms currently used to send commit emails from GitHub to the Commits list (<https://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/commits>) will be deprecated in January 2019: <https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-04-25-github-services-deprecation/>

Before then we should find a replacement for it.
