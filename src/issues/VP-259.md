I almost always follow an integrated video to its youtube page, to view/participate in the comment discussion, see views, and possibly use other youtube features (make video larger, tho ours might take care of that issue). Consider adding a link to that youtube page so viewers can get more information about the vid. "View on youtube"? Something like that.
