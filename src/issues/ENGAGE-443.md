The fact that the description can be fully read without surrendering screen real estate is an affordance VO users have over other users.\n\nBut I can see a boundary use case where the device's primary user is a VO user, and he/she has listened to the description and wants to show it to his/her sighted friend to read. How, then, would the VO user expand the description for his/her friend?\n\nThe middle-of-road solution would be to force VO users to read a truncated description (just like sighted users), and expand it to read the rest (again, just like sighted users).\n"

Because the part of the description is hidden using max-height and not display none, the hidden part is actually accessible by the screen reader on artifact page even if the description is collapsed.
