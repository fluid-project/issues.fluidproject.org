Example program: <https://develop-1-2--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.2&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA0s1z&c=aab&d=>

 

Expected:

* Loop to be skipped and no movement to happen

 

Actual:

* Loop is executed once

 

Options:

* Fix: Update the ‘startLoop\` handling in the Interpreter to jump to the end of the loop if the iterations left is 0
* Or, as a workaround, only enable the user to enter 1-99 iterations and don’t allow 0
