On narrower displays, especially with font size increased, (confirmed on iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and Google Pixel), the "Build your story" button at the top of either the Browse or View page wraps across lines and looks broken. Consider moving the language selection menu to a new line in the flow to make room for its full width.
