Resetting changed preferences does not save the new reset state to the store.

Â 

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the UIO Demo
   1. <https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/>
2. Open the prefs editor
3. Change a preference, e.g contrast
4. Click reset
5. Reload the page
6. Notice that the setting is still applied.

You can get the reset to work if you reset before any preferences have been changed. For example after a page reload, resetting will actually store the reset values.
