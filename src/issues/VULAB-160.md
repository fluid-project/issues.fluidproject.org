We need to put in methods that we want in all Controllers here.\n\nNOTE: at this point this controller may not be exactly how we want it, but I want it into svn as this point to patch off of for the future.\n"

CakePHP's controllers all extend Class: AppController and you can extend the native controller by creative an app\_controller.php of your own.

So we need to add in functions that we want to be available to all controllers. (At this point, basic CRUD functions)
