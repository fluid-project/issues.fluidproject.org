It is very easy to generate a very long URL which will cause an error. We should:

* Limit number of path segments
* Simplify path segments: extend the last path segment, rather than add a new path segment, if a new movement is in the same direction as the last path segment
* If we move such that we are retracing (direction and length) the last path segment, we don’t need to record a new path segment for that movement
