When we fixed the infamous pause bug (<https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-822#icft=FLUID-822>), we changed the server behavior so that when and upload is stopped by the user, the upload process continues until the currently uploading file is complete (or errors). \[See <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-822#icft=FLUID-822> for a full description]

We did not change the behavior for the demo version of the uploader since there wasn't really a "bug" there since there wasn't really an upload.

However, the demo version should really mimic the server version to give an accurate mirror of the actual user experience.&#x20;
