      "body": "We have tried a number of strategies for delaying the initialization and playing of sounds in Tone.js, but we haven't been able to get rid of the warnings.\n\nThere is a Tone.js issue with some discussion regarding \"The AudioContext was not allowed to start\" warnings: <https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/776>. And at this point, it looks most likely that the warnings are from Tone.js code that is out of our control.\n\nI'm going to leave this issue open, but we won't do any more work on it for now. If Tone.js is changed to remove these warnings, at that time we can see if we need to make any code changes.\n"
