A policy of&#x20;\n\n\"strings.defaultViewText\": \"defaultViewText\"\n\nshould have the desired effect although I am hesitant to very positively recommend this change since this part of the framework has a rickety and incomplete implementation which might well change soon - I left some comments on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4733#icft=FLUID-4733> on this aspect of mergePolicies.\\\nSeparately whilst reading these fixes I noted <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4732#icft=FLUID-4732> which we should deal with sooner rather than later. Removing the explicit read of a component's defaults (never recommended as a general practice) would also reduce the impact of fixing <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4732#icft=FLUID-4732>.\n"

The designers have suggested that the 'defaultViewText' for an empty inlineEdit (default is "Click here to edit") change when the field receives keyboard focus, to something that includes instructions for pressing enter to edit, such as "Click here or press enter to edit." The defaultViewText is overridable, so I imagine the focused view text should also be overridable.

The component already binds functionality to the focus and blur events, so I imagine it shouldn't be too hard to include a change of the text.
