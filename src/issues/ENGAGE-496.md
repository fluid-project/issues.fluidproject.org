As part of the work on ENGAGE-434, the "standard" methods of injecting \<script> tags into \<head> on Safari have been discovered to be not reliable. It appears that even the method in jQuery.globalEval (proposed by Giammarchi) does not succeed in being synchronous, as well as not causing the sources to be visibile in the debugger. This is a blocker for Engage since loading jquery.ui.core and jquery.ui.dialog in succession repeatably results in a broken image, causing the send dialog in myCollection to fail.
