At the moment, there's nothing built into jqUnit that helps us test the order and contents of function invocations. For example, in the DemoUploadManager, the core logic is orchestrational: it's important to test that each callback function is called in the correct order, and that the arguments are appropriate.

An "invocation tracker" in jqUnit would be immensely helpful.
