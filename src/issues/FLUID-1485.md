Double clicking while picking up an element causes the avatar to freeze. The pointer will still assume it is dragging the avatar and will cause drop markers to appear.

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the sortable vertical list demo from the daily build site:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/fluid/sample-code/reorderer/todo-list/sortable-styled-todo-list.html>

2\) Start quicly clicking the mouse while you pick up the element.

Notice that the avatar freezes and the pointer is able to generate drop targets as you move it around the screen
