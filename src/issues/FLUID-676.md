When using the Reorderer API that takes a map of finder functions, selectable items that are not movable are initialized without the appropriate style.&#x20;

This can be seen in the 'list' manual test:\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/sakai-imagegallery-tool/tests/fluid-tests/manual/list/list.html>

Upon first load of the page, the second list in this example has list items that are not movable and do not have a 'default' style. If you tab to the list and arrow through the items, you will see that the non movable list items receive a 'selected' style upon selection and a 'default' style once it is no longer selected.&#x20;

There is an automated test in ReorderListTests that has been commented out due to this bug.
