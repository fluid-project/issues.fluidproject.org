      "body": "<https://github.com/anvk/videoPlayer/tree/FLUID-4751>\n\nNVDA+FF - works fine. With every time change it reads out how number out of total value.\\\nNVDA+IE - reads slider information + reads the span information with word \"grouping\". It also may read the whole content of the transcripts which is the same related issue as in <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-4750#icft=FLUID-4750>. With every time change it reads number of seconds as a number (e.g. \"five\" or \"nine\" or \"fourteen\")\\\nNVDA+Chrome - reads out \"Time scrub editable, time scrub blank\". With every time change it reads \"blank\"\n\nSafari+VoiceOver = says \"0 00 of 5 4 3 time scrub\". With a time change it reads new numbers without \"time scrub\" part but if you refocus back it will read this additional part. (before I thought that it just reads out the internal span because of the weird way it speaks out the time but if you remove it behaviour stays the same)\n\nJAWS + Chrome - On tab focus it tells you \"Time scrub\". \"You have to press Enter to enter the application mode. 0.01 out of 5 43. Time scrub left right slider. Progress complete. If you refocus back on the time scrub it will just tell you something like 0 4 out 5 43\\\nJAWS + IE - No need to enter an application mode. It will read time slider left right then time. Sometimes it reads out the time twice and will add word \"hundred\" at the end.\\\nJAWS + FF - No need to enter an application mode. Reads \"Time scrub\" on the change it will read \"0 4 out of 5 43\". Works pretty well.\n\nIt would be good to hide the span so that in some cases the text would not be read twice.\n"

Jaws+FF:\
When focus lands on the scrub-bar/time display, Jaws says "left right slider time scrub link," doesn't actually say current time.\
When using the arrow keys to move the scrub bar, scrub bar doesn't move, Jaws reads out letters from something

Jaws+IE9:\
When focus lands on the scrub-bar/time display, Jaws says "slider time scrub link," then start and end time (0 time as "zero o'clock").\
When using the arrow keys to move the scrub bar, Jaws reads the current caption block when it appears, "one hundred" otherwise.

NVDA+FF:\
When focus lands on the scrub-bar/time display, NVDA says "slider time scrub link," doesn't actually say current time.\
When using the arrow keys to move the scrub bar, NVDA starts reading out the entire caption file, won't stop.

NVDA+IE9:\
When focus lands on the scrub-bar/time display, NVDA says start and end time, then "slider time scrub link," then start and end time.\
When using the arrow keys to move the scrub bar, NVDA sounds a couple of strange tones the first time, then silence.

VoiceOver+Safari:\
When focus lands on the scrub-bar/time display, VoiceOver says "slider," doesn't actually say the current time\
When using the arrow keys to move the scrub bar, VoiceOver reads the current caption block when it appears; pressing arrow again will interrupt speech.

Note: for Jaws testing, Jaws was manually switched into application mode (virtual PC cursor 'off')
