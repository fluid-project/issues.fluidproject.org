When scrolling through languages using the up and down arrows (either by keyboard or mouse), the act of scrolling also changes the current language selection to the next on the list, which causes the page to reload into that language. Focus is lost, and the user has to start all over. It would be nice if the user could scroll through the languages, see what's available, identify what they want and THEN take some action to enact that language.&#x20;

***

On May 19, 2015, Dana, Anastasia, Cindy, and Simon met to clarify the desired behaviour:

In the following, the term "active" is used for the language set in the user's preferences and in which the UI is rendered; the term "focused" is used for the language with keyboard focus. The active and focused languages might differ.

* The active language is indicated with a triangle and the name of the language is written in yellow
* Clicking on one of the arrow buttons with the mouse scrolls the list of languages and does not change the active language (the active language may scroll off screen)
* Clicking on a language button with the mouse activates the language
* When focus is moved to the language list, the list of visible languages is not changed and the language at the top of the list is given focus (this might not be the active language)
* When focus leaves the language list, the list of visible languages is not changed â€“ the list stays at the same position
* Pressing the arrow keys moves the focus to the language above or below (scrolling as necessary) but does not change the active language
* Pressing enter or space on a language button makes that language active
* When the language panel is first displayed, or the user navigates back to it from another panel, the language list is scrolled to show the active language
