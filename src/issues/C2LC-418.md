They work in Firefox, but not in Chrome or Edge.

Steps to reproduce:

* Run Weavly in Chrome or Edge
* Run Grid 3 with the Weavly grid set
* Activate the “Actions” cell in the top left of the Weavly grid

Expected:

* The Actions Panel to be scanned

Actual

* Focus is advanced based on where the focus currently is
* The Actions Panel is not focused before the sending of tabs

Analysis:

When key presses are sent from a physical keyboard, the keydown events in Chrome have both `code` and `key` set. However, when the key presses are sent from Grid 3, `key` is set, but `code` is not set (empty string).
