An IoCSS selector with more than 2 components starting at the root component, such as "{/ remote-component-root fluid.modelComponent}.options.gradeNames", causes a failure when instantiating any component which matches the final component. This has not been noticed so far since all such global selectors have been of the simple form {/ fluid.modelComponent} etc. The failure cause is that there is no contextHashes entry for the root component which has always been instantiated by a special route and is not a genuine component.
