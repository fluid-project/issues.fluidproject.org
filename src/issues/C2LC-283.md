As discussed in last week's sprint planning, Sepi suggested that we reinforce which command has been dropped.  She suggested increasing the size and having it return to normal after a short wait.  I suggested having the size increase when picking up the icon in the first place, so that it appears as though the dragged icon is closer and so that it appears to be dropped away from the user.
