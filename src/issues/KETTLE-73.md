<https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3309> reports that our default logging in DataSource when issuing a HTTP request logs some information which is sensitive. We should provide a configuration option to DataSources which can selectively suppress this info, and then supply distributions in the FlowManager and Preferences server which engage this configuration.
