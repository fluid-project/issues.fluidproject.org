The "reverse" option to the fluid options merging algorithm does not correctly preserve the structure in the target of the merge. This merging policy is used when options supplied by subcomponents are submitted for merging against the top-level options structure. This leads to inconvenience, as well as some fragility, when these subcomponent options need to be customised by users. For example, in the uploader, in file&#x20;

<https://source.fluidproject.org/svn/fluid/image-gallery/trunk/web/src/main/webapp/AddImages.html>

the following section appears:

decorators: {\
type: "fluid.swfUploadSetupDecorator",\
options: {\
flash9URL: "../../fluid-components/flash/swfupload\_f9.swf",\
flash10URL: "../../fluid-components/flash/swfupload\_f10.swf",\
flashButtonImageURL: "../../fluid-components/images/uploader/browse.png"\
}\
}

the specification of "type" should be inherited from the default options and not require respecification unless it requires to be modified.
