Already a convention has been established, that involves boilerplate configuration as follows:

fluid.defaults("fluid.tests.child4257", {\
gradeNames: \["fluid.eventedComponent", "autoInit"],\
preInitFunction: "fluid.tests.child4257.preInit"  \
});

It should be the case that any function which conforms to such a naming scheme (consisting of the component name followed by one of the recognised lifecycle function names, preInit, postInit or finalInit) is automatically registered as a handler for the relevant lifecycle point.
