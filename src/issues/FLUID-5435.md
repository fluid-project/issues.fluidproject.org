Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the versioning manual test\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/versioning.html>

2\) Attempt to reorder the list under the Fluid-0.3 version.\
Notice that it doesn't not work with either the mouse or the keyboard. The 1.5 version does work. There are no failures reported in the console.
