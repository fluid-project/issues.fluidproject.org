At the moment, fluid.model.transform.valueMapper() will throw an error if:

1\. the specified inputPath resolves to undefined in the source model\
2\. there is no defaultInputValue specified

In the GPII, we have found that it can legitimately be the case that a path simply isn't available in the source model and there's no relevant default value (or it would be extremely tedious to specify a default value of "undefined" for each rule).

valueMapper() should be modified to simply do nothing in the above case.
