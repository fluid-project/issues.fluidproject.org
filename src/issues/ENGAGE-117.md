At the moment, there are a few remaining places where paths are hardcoded in JavaScript. These include calls to mountDirectory() and any path rewriting rules specified as part of the options to kettle.renderHandler().

We should ensure that all file paths are located in configuration so that it's easy to deploy Kettle apps on a standalone server without breaking everything.
