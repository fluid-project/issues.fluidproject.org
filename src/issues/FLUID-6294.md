Due to the serial nature of screen readers, It would be beneficial to have the 'Show Preferences' button appear above the expanding UI Options widget.  Most screen readers would expect the next item to be below or to the right of the current selection. &#x20;

Rather than having to override styling and the template to put the 'Show Preferences' button above the expanding UI options, it would be nice to have an option to choose where to place the 'Show Preferences' button, either above or below.
