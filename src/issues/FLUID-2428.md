At the moment, a user can only specify POST parameters to the Uploader upon instantiation. There's no API for dynamically modifying these parameters during the process of interacting with the Uploader.

An in-depth discussion of the issue can be found in Aaron Brown's excellent post to the list:

<http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2009-March/004130.html>

We need a public method on Uploader to allow users to update these parameters whenever they want.
