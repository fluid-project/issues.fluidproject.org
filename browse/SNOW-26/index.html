<p>Jonathan Hung and I found that as a limitation of Wordpress, only posts can support custom metadata (the "is_landing_page" custom field) and so only posts can be landing pages. We will need to figure out a way to generate landing pages from page types as well but that will require a custom metadata from pages and will need to extract that into a query. This will require at least a week's worth of work.</p>

<p>With the current sidebar code we can only nest once. Jon and I talked about a possible solution which is to create two Wordpress queries: one to get the parents (the main categories that appear on the menu), and then another one to get the children of each of the parents, then generate the sidebar in a nested query. We'd need to spend some time to create those queries and make sure they return the results we want, test to make sure it is robust, and then style it. This might take 3-4 days worth of work, but Jon mentioned that somewhere down the line there is some refactoring that needs to be done for the sidebar so this might just be as short-term solution.</p>

<p>from Caren: I was thinking the deeper nesting would be transferred to the breadcrumbs, but as my conversation with Jon revealed, the back end does not transfer nesting levels over to breadcrumbs.</p>
