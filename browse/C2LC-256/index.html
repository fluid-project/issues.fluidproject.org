                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>There was some feedback from Bridges about better distinguishing direction and speed of movement.  Currently, the same sound is used when executing forward1, forward2, and forward3.  They asked if we could better distinguish between these.</p>
<p>As we already use pitch and panning for position, I would like to avoid reusing either of those for this.  My initial idea is to use the tempo of the speed to distinguish the speed of an action.  So, forward2 would play faster, not necessarily twice as fast, but noticeably faster than forward.  forward3 would play the fastest, noticeably faster than forward2.</p>
<p>Turns play the same sound, but play it for 1/4 the length of a movement for a 45 degree turn, 1/2 the length of a movement for a 90 degree turn, and the full length of a movement for a 180 degree turn.  Bridges felt this was effective in distinguishing between the turns, but I think long term I'd rather not second guess the movement duration.  I'd like to at least try using the same strategy with turns.  So, the sequence for 45 degrees would play the most slowly.  The sequence for 90 degrees would play faster, not necessarily twice as fast, but noticeably faster than 45 degrees  The sequence for 180 degrees would play the fastest, not necessarily four times faster, but noticeably faster than 90 degrees.  All sounds would play the full duration for the first proof of concept, but we can trivially compare them.</p>
<p>They also indicated that they could not distinguish the direction of the turn.  We currently use one sequence for "left" and the same sequence in reverse for "right".  This was not enough.  We have discussed using a different sequence for each direction as a solution for this.</p>
<p>As part of this, I'd propose renaming the sound directories to match their associated action.  I would move the existing left-turn sound to left90 and make a slower and faster version.  I would record three new sequence for right turns at the same tempo as the left turns.  I would move the existing forward sound to forward and make a version that plays two notes in the same time for forward2 and three notes in the same time for forward3.</p>

                        <p>As discussed, there's already a pull and Sepi is happy with the sounds, I just need to update this with the latest develop-0.7 and get it ready for review.</p>
